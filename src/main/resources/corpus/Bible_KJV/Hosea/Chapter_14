 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by
thine iniquity.


 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the
calves of our lips.


 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither
will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in
thee the fatherless findeth mercy.


 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
anger is turned away from him.


 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and
cast forth his roots as Lebanon.


 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive
tree, and his smell as Lebanon.


 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive
as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the
wine of Lebanon.


 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?  I have
heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.  From me is
thy fruit found.


 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?  prudent, and
he shall know them?  for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just
shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
