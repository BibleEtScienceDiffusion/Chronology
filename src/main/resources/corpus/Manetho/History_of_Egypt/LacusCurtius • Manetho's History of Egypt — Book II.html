Sethôs drove out Hermaeus and reigned for 59&nbsp;years; then Rampsês, the elder of his sons, for 66&nbsp;years. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.232">232</a>&nbsp;Thus, after admitting that so many years had elapsed since our forefathers left Egypt, Manetho now interpolates this intruding Amenôphis.

Among them, Manetho adds, there were some of the learned priests, who had been attacked by leprosy. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.236">236</a>&nbsp;Then this wise seer Amenôphis was filled with dread of divine wrath against himself and the king if the outrage done to these persons should be discovered; and he added a prediction that certain allies would join the polluted people and would take possession of Egypt for 13&nbsp;years. Not venturing to make this prophecy himself to the king, he left a full account of it in writing, and then took his own life. The king was filled with despondency. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.237">237</a>&nbsp;Then Manetho continues as follows (I&nbsp;quote his account <i>verbatim</i>): "When the men in the stone-quarries had suffered hardships for a considerable time, they begged the king to assign to them as a dwelling-place and a refuge the deserted city of the Shepherds, Auaris, and he consented.

<a id="p129"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p129&nbsp;</span></a>and before long arrived at Auaris. When Amenôphis, king of Egypt, learned of their invasion, he was sorely troubled, for he recalled the prediction of Amenôphis, son of Paapis. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.244">244</a>&nbsp;First, he gathered a multitude of Egyptians; and having taken counsel with the leading men among them, he summoned to his presence the sacred animals which were held in greatest reverence in the temples, and gave instructions to each group of priests to conceal the images of the gods as securely as possible. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.245">245</a>&nbsp;As for his five-year‑old son Rapsês,<a class="ref" id="ref93" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note93" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">93</a> he sent him safely away to his friend.<a class="ref" id="ref94" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note94" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">94</a> He then crossed the Nile with as many as 300,000 of the bravest warriors of Egypt, and met the enemy. But, instead of joining battle, <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.246">246</a>&nbsp;he decided that he must not fight against the gods, and made a hasty retreat to Memphis. There he took into his charge Apis and the other sacred animals which he had summoned to that place; and forthwith he set off for Ethiopia<a class="ref" id="ref95" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note95" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">95</a> with his whole army and the host of Egyptians. The Ethiopian king, who, in gratitude for a service, had become his subject, <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.247">247</a>&nbsp;welcomed him, maintained the whole multitude with such products of the country as were fit for human consumption,


<a id="p131"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p131&nbsp;</span></a>assigned to them cities and villages sufficient for the destined period of 13&nbsp;years' banishment from his realm, and especially stationed an Ethiopian army on the frontiers of Egypt to guard King Amenôphis and his followers. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.248">248</a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Solymites <span class="emend">[or dwellers in Jerusalem]</span> made a descent along with the polluted Egyptians, and treated the people so impiously and savagely that the domination of the Shepherds seemed like a golden age to those who witnessed the present enormities. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.249">249</a>&nbsp;For not only did they set towns and villages on fire, pillaging the temples and mutilating images of the gods without restraint, but they also made a practice of using the sanctuaries as kitchens to roast the sacred animals which the people worshipped: and they would compel the priests and prophets to sacrifice and butcher the beasts, afterwards casting the men forth naked. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.250">250</a>&nbsp;It is said that the priest who framed their constitution and their laws was a native of Hêliopolis, named Osarsêph after the god Osiris, worshipped at Hêliopolis; but when he joined this people, he changed his name and was called Moses."<a class="ref" id="ref96" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note96" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">96</a>

<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.251">251</a>&nbsp;Such, then, are the Egyptian stories about the Jews,<a class="ref" id="ref97" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note97" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">97</a> together with many other tales which I&nbsp;pass


<a id="p133"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p133&nbsp;</span></a>by for brevity's sake. Manetho adds, however, that, at a later date, Amenôphis advanced from Ethiopia with a large army, his son Rampsês also leading a force, and that the two together joined battle with the Shepherds and their polluted allies, and defeated them, killing many and pursuing the others to the frontiers of Syria. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.252">252</a>&nbsp;This then, with other tales of a like nature, is Manetho's account. Before I&nbsp;give proof that his words are manifest lies and nonsense, I&nbsp;shall mention one particular point, which bears upon my later refutation of other writers. Manetho has made one concession to us. He has admitted that our race was not Egyptian in origin, but came into Egypt from elsewhere, took possession of the land, and afterwards left it. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.253">253</a>&nbsp;But that we were not, at a later time, mixed up with disease-ravaged Egyptians, and that, so far from being one of these, Moses, the leader of our people, lived many generations earlier, I&nbsp;shall endeavour to prove from Manetho's own statements.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.254">254</a>&nbsp;To begin with, the reason which he suggests for his fiction is ridiculous. "King Amenôphis," he says, "conceived a desire to see the gods." Gods indeed! If he means the gods established by their ordinances, — bull, goat, crocodiles, and dog‑faced baboons, — he had them before his eyes; <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.255">255</a>&nbsp;and as for the gods of heaven, how could he see them? And why did he conceive this eager desire? Because, by Zeus,<a class="ref" id="ref98" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note98" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">98</a> before his time another king


<a id="p135"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p135&nbsp;</span></a>had seen them! From this predecessor, then, he had learned their nature and the manner in which he had seen them, and in consequence he had no need of a new system. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.256">256</a>&nbsp;Moreover, the prophet by whose aid the king expected to succeed in his endeavour, was a sage. How, then, did he fail to foresee the impossibility of realizing this desire? It did, in fact, come to naught. And what reason had he for ascribing the invisibility of the gods to the presence of cripples or lepers? Divine wrath is due to impious deeds, not to physical deformities. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.257">257</a>&nbsp;Next, how could 80,000&nbsp;lepers and invalids be gathered together in practically a single day? The prophet had bidden him expel the cripples from Egypt, but the king cast them into stone-quarries, as if he needed labourers, not as if his purpose was to purge the land. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.258">258</a>&nbsp;Manetho says, moreover, that the prophet took his own life, because he foresaw the anger of the gods and the fate in store for Egypt, but left in writing his prediction to the king. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.259">259</a>&nbsp;Then how was it that the prophet had not from the first foreknowledge of his own death? Why did he not forthwith oppose the king's desire to see the gods? Was it reasonable to be afraid of misfortunes which were not to happen in his time? Or what worse fate could have been his than that which he hastened to inflict upon himself?

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.260">260</a>&nbsp;But let us now examine<a class="ref" id="ref99" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note99" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">99</a> the most ridiculous part


<a id="p137"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p137&nbsp;</span></a>of the whole story. Although he had learned these facts, and conceived a dread of the future, the king did not, even then, expel from his land those cripples of whose taint he had previously been bidden to purge Egypt, but instead, at their request, he gave them as their city (Manetho says) the former habitation of the Shepherds, Auaris, as it was called. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.261">261</a>&nbsp;Here, he adds, they assembled, and selected as their leader a man who had formerly been a priest in Heliopolis. This man (according to Manetho) instructed them not to worship the gods nor to refrain from the animals revered in Egypt, but to sacrifice and devour them all, and to have intercourse with none save those of their own confederacy. Then having bound his followers by oath to abide strictly by these laws, he fortified Auaris and waged war against the king. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.262">262</a>&nbsp;This leader, Manetho adds, sent to Jerusalem, inviting the people to join in alliance with him, and promising to give them Auaris, which, he reminded them, was the ancestral home of those who would come from Jerusalem, and would serve as a base for their conquest of the whole of Egypt. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.263">263</a>&nbsp;Then, continues Manetho, they advanced with an army of 200,000&nbsp;men; and Amenôphis, king of Egypt, thinking he ought not to fight against the gods, fled straightway into Ethiopia after enjoining that Apis and some of the other sacred animals should be entrusted to the custody of the priests. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.264">264</a>&nbsp;Thereafter, the men from Jerusalem came on, made desolate the cities, burned down the temples, massacred


<a id="p139"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p139&nbsp;</span></a>the priests, and, in short, committed every possible kind of lawlessness and savagery. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.265">265</a>&nbsp;The priest who framed their constitution and their laws was, according to Manetho, a native of Hêliopolis, Osarsêph by name, after Osiris the god worshipped in Hêliopolis: but he changed his name and called himself Moses. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.266">266</a>&nbsp;Thirteen years later — this being the destined period of his exile — Amenôphis, according to Manetho, advanced from Ethiopia with a large army, and joining battle with the Shepherds and the polluted people, he defeated them, killing many, after pursuing them to the frontiers of Syria.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.267">267</a>&nbsp;Here again Manetho fails to realize the improbability of his lying tale. Even if the lepers and their accompanying horde were previously angry with the king and the others who had treated them thus in obedience to the seer's prediction, certainly when they had left the stone-quarries and received from him a city and land, they would have grown more kindly disposed to him. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.268">268</a>&nbsp;If indeed they still hated him, they would have plotted against him personally, instead of declaring war against the whole people; for obviously so large a company must have had numerous relatives in Egypt. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.269">269</a>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, once they had resolved to make war on the Egyptians, they would never have ventured to direct their warfare against their gods, nor would they have framed laws completely opposed to the ancestral code under which they had been brought up. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.270">270</a>&nbsp;We must, however, be grateful to Manetho for stating that the


<a id="p141"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p141&nbsp;</span></a>authors of this lawlessness were not the newcomers from Jerusalem, but that company of people who were themselves Egyptians, and that it was, above all, their priests who devised the scheme and bound the multitude by oath.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.271">271</a>&nbsp;Moreover, how absurd it is to imagine that, while none of their relatives and friends joined in the revolt and shared in the perils of war, these polluted persons sent to Jerusalem and gained allies there! <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.272">272</a>&nbsp;What alliance, what connexion had previously existed between them? Why, on the contrary, they were enemies, and differed widely in customs. Yet Manetho says that they lent a ready ear to the promise that they would occupy Egypt, just as if they were not thoroughly acquainted with the country from which they had been forcibly expelled! <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.273">273</a>&nbsp;Now, if they had been in straitened or unusual circumstances, they would perhaps have taken the risk; but dwelling, as they did, in a prosperous city and enjoying the fruits of an ample country, superior to Egypt, why ever should they be likely to hazard their lives by succouring their former foes, those maimed cripples, whom none even of their own kinsfolk could endure? For of course they did not foresee that the king would take flight. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.274">274</a>&nbsp;On the contrary, Manetho has himself stated that the son<a class="ref" id="ref100" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note100" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">100</a> of


<a id="p143"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p143&nbsp;</span></a>Amenôphis marched with 300,000&nbsp;men to confront them at Pêlusium. This was certainly known to those already present; but how could they possibly guess that he would charting his mind and flee? <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.275">275</a>&nbsp;Manetho next says that, after conquering Egypt, the invaders from Jerusalem committed many heinous crimes; and for these he reproaches them, just as if he had not brought them in as enemies, or as if he was bound to accuse allies from abroad of actions which before their arrival native Egyptians were performing and had sworn to perform. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.276">276</a>&nbsp;But, years later, Amenôphis returned to the attack, conquered the enemy in battle, and drove them, with slaughter, right to Syria. So perfectly easy a prey is Egypt to invaders, no matter whence they come! <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.277">277</a>&nbsp;And yet those who at that time conquered the land, on learning that Amenôphis was alive, neither fortified the passes between it and Ethiopia, although their resources were amply sufficient, nor did they keep the rest of their forces in readiness! Amenôphis, according to Manetho, pursued them with carnage over the sandy desert right to Syria. But obviously it is no easy matter for an army to cross the desert even without fighting.

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.278">278</a>&nbsp;Thus, according to Manetho, our race is not of Egyptian origin, nor did it receive any admixture of Egyptians. For, naturally, many of the lepers and invalids died in the stone-quarries during their long term of hardship, many others in the subsequent battles, and most of all in the final engagement and the rout.

	</p><p class="justify" id="p145"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p145&nbsp;</span>
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.279">279</a>&nbsp;It remains for me to reply to Manetho's statements about Moses. The Egyptians regard him as a wonderful, even a divine being, but wish to claim him as their own by an incredible calumny, alleging that he belonged to Hêliopolis and was dismissed from his priesthood there owing to leprosy. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.280">280</a>&nbsp;The records, however, show that he lived 518&nbsp;years<a class="ref" id="ref101" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note101" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">101</a> earlier, and led our forefathers up out of Egypt to the land which we inhabit at the present time. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.281">281</a>&nbsp;And that he suffered from no such physical affliction is clear from his own words. He has, in fact, forbidden lepers<a class="ref" id="ref102" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note102" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">102</a> either to stay in a town or to make their abode in a village; they must go about in solitude, with their garments rent. Anyone who touches them or lives under the same roof with them he considers unclean. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.282">282</a>&nbsp;Moreover, even if the malady is cured and the leper resumes normal health, Moses has prescribed certain rites of purification — to cleanse himself in a bath of spring-water and to shave off all his hair, — and enjoins the performance of a&nbsp;number of different sacrifices before entrance into the holy city. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.283">283</a>&nbsp;Yet it would have been natural, on the contrary, for a victim of this scourge to show some consideration and kindly feeling for those who shared the same misfortune. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.284">284</a>&nbsp;It was not only about lepers that he framed such laws: those who had even the slightest mutilation of the body were disqualified for the priesthood;<a class="ref" id="ref103" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note103" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">103</a> and if a priest in the course of his ministry met with an


<a id="p147"><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;p147&nbsp;</span></a>accident of this nature, he was deprived of his office. <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.285">285</a>&nbsp;How improbable, then, that Moses should be so foolish as to frame these laws, or that men brought together by such misfortunes should approve of legislation against themselves, to their own shame and injury! <a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.286">286</a>&nbsp;But, further, the name, too, has been transformed in an extremely improbable way. According to Manetho, Moses was called Osarsêph. These names, however, are not interchangeable: the true name means "one saved out of the water," for water is called "<span class="archaic">mō‑y</span>" by the Egyptians.<a class="ref" id="ref104" href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/2*.html#note104" onmouseover="return Ebox(INARRAY,EdNote,WIDTH,180)" onmouseout="nd();">104</a>

	</p><p class="justify">
<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.287">287</a>&nbsp;It is now, therefore, sufficiently obvious, I&nbsp;think, that, so long as Manetho followed the ancient records, he did not stray far from the truth; but when he turned to unauthorized legends, he either combined them in an improbable form or else gave credence to certain prejudiced informants.

The name of Amenemhêt bespeaks his Theban origin; he removed the capital further north to Dahshûr, a more central position — "Controller of the Two Lands," as its Egyptian name means. Thus the kings of Dynasty&nbsp;XII are kings who came from Thebes, but ruled at Dahshûr.

In Dynasty&nbsp;XII the conquests of Dynasty&nbsp;VI in the south were extended; and Sesôstris&nbsp;III was the first Egyptian king to conquer Syria. Among works of peace the great irrigation schemes in the Fayûm perpetuated the name of Amenemhêt&nbsp;III in "Lake Moeris". (See G.&nbsp;Caton-Thompson and E.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Gardner, <i>The Desert Fayûm</i>, 1934.) Manetho mentions his building of the Labyrinth; it is significant that after the reign of Sesôstris&nbsp;III and his wide foreign conquests, his son should have built the Labyrinth. Vases of the Kamares type from Crete have been found at Kahûn, not far from the Labyrinth.

The invasion of the Hyksôs took place at some time in Dynasty&nbsp;XIII: hence the succeeding anarchy in a period of foreign domination. The later Egyptians looked back upon it as the Jews did upon the Babylonian captivity, or the English upon the Danish terror. The keen desire of the Egyptians to forget about the Hyksôs usurpation accounts in part for our ignorance of what actually happened: "it is with apparent unwillingness that they chronicle any events connected with it" (Peet, <i>Egypt and the Old Testament</i>, p69). In Egyptian texts the "infamous" (Hyksôs) were denoted as <span class="archaic">ʿAmu</span>, a title also given to the Hittites and their allies by Ramessês&nbsp;II in the poem of the Battle of Kadesh (ed.&nbsp;Kuentz, §&nbsp;97). Perhaps they were combined with Hittites who in&nbsp;1925&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span> brought the kingdom of Babel to an end. It is certain that with the Hyksôs numerous Semites came into Egypt: some of the Hyksôs kings have Semitic names. For the presence of an important Hurrian element among the Hyksôs, see E.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Speiser, "Ethnic Movements," in <i>Ann. of Amer. Sch. of Or.&nbsp;Res.</i> <span class="small">XIII</span> (1932), p51. The


<a id="p77x"></a>Hyksôs brought with them from Asia their tribal god, which was assimilated by the Egyptian to Sêth, the god of foreign parts, of the desert, and of the enemy.
	</p><p class="i1 b0 a0 justify">
In the first half of the second millennium&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span> the Hyksôs ruled a great kingdom in Palestine and Syria (Meyer, <i>Geschichte</i><span class="superscript">5</span>, <span class="small">I</span>&nbsp;§&nbsp;304); and when their power was broken down by the arrival of hostile tribes, King Amôsis took advantage of their plight to drive the Hyksôs out of Egypt (A.&nbsp;Jirku, "Aufstieg und Untergang der Hyksôs," in <i>Journ. of the Palestine Orient.&nbsp;Soc.</i> <span class="small">XII</span>,&nbsp;1932, p60).

This account of the Hyksôs invasion is obviously derived from popular Egyptian tales, the characteristics of which are deeply imprinted upon it. Meyer (<i>Geschichte</i><span class="superscript">5</span>, <span class="small">I</span>.ii&nbsp;p313) quotes from papyri and inscriptions passages of similar style and content, <i>e.g.</i>&nbsp;Pap.&nbsp;Sallier&nbsp;I describing the war with the Hyksôs, and mentioning "Lord Apôpi in Auaris," and an inscription of Queen Hatshepsut from the Speos Artemidos, referring to the occupation of

Auaris, in Ancient Egyptian <span class="archaic">Hetwaʿret</span>, "town of the desert strip," but this meaning does not explain the "religious tradition". (The older interpretations, "house of the flight," "house of the leg," were attached to the Seth-Typhôn legend: <i>cf.</i>&nbsp;n.&nbsp;3 <i>infra</i>.) Tanis was a stronghold


<a id="p81x"></a>of the Hyksôs: in

<i>O.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Numbers</i> xiii.22</a>, "Now Hebron (in S.&nbsp;Palestine) was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt," Zoan is Tanis (<span class="archaic">Djaʿnet</span>), and the statement probably refers to the Hyksôs age. Sethe cautiously said, "Seth is the god of the Hyksôs cities, Tanis and Auaris." But in <i>Revue Biblique</i>, <span class="small">XXXIX</span>,&nbsp;1930, pp5‑28, Pierre Montet, the excavator of Tanis, brought forward reasons to identify Auaris and Pi‑Raʿmesses with Tanis; and Alan&nbsp;H. Gardiner (<i>J.&nbsp;Eg.&nbsp;Arch.</i> <span class="small">XIX</span>,&nbsp;1933, pp122‑128)<!--</A>JOURNAL:JEgArch19--> gave further evidence this view (p126): "San&nbsp;el‑Hagar marks the site of the city successively called Auaris, Pi‑Raʿmesse, and Tanis". In spite of the criticism of Raymond Weill (<i>J.&nbsp;Eg.&nbsp;Arch.</i> <span class="small">XXI</span>,&nbsp;1935, pp10‑25)<!--</A>JOURNAL:JEgArch21-->, who cited a hieroglyphic document (found in the temple of Ptah in Memphis) in which Auaris and "the field (or land) of Tanis" are separate, Pierre Montet (<i>Syria</i>, <span class="small">XVII</span>,&nbsp;1936, pp200‑202) maintains the identity of Auaris, Pi‑Raʿmesses, and Tanis.

Meanwhile, a new identification of Pi‑Raʿmessês had been suggested: by excavation M.&nbsp;Hamza (<i>Annales du&nbsp;Service des Antiquités de&nbsp;l'Égypte</i>, <span class="small">XXX</span> 1930, p65) found evidence tending to identify Pi‑Raʿmessês with the palace of Ramessês&nbsp;II at Tell el‑Yahudîya, near Kantîr, <i>c.</i>&nbsp;25&nbsp;kilometres south of Tanis; and William&nbsp;C. Hayes (<i>Glazed Tiles from a Palace of Ramessês&nbsp;II at Kantîr: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Papers</i>, No.&nbsp;3, 1937) supports this theory that Kantîr was the Delta residence of the Ramesside kings of Egypt, pointing out that there is a practically


<a id="p82x"></a>unbroken series of royal Ramesside monuments which cover a period of almost 200&nbsp;years.

In&nbsp;1906 Petrie discovered at Kantîr a vast fortified encampment of Hyksôs date and a Hyksôs cemetery: see Petrie, <i>Hyksôs and Israelite Cities</i>, pp3‑16 (the earthwork ramparts of the camp were intended to protect an army of chariots).

Of these Hyksôs names Bnôn and Apachnan are unexplained. Apôpi (the name of several kings — at least three), and perhaps Asêth (Assis), seem to be pure Egyptian: Iannas is presumed to be Khian, whose cartouche turned up surprisingly and significantly on the lid of an alabastron in the Palace of Minos at Knossos in Crete, as well as on a basalt lion from Baghdad.

Josephus, in revising this treatise just as he revised his <i>Antiquities</i>, appears to have used a second version of Manetho's <i>Aegyptiaca</i>.

This statement of the Phoenician origin of the Hyksôs kings has generally been discredited until recently: now the Ras esh‑Shamra tablets, which imply a pantheon strikingly similar to that of the Hyksôs, have shown that the Hyksôs were closely related to the Phoenicians.

The Armenian text of this sentence is rather difficult, but Professor Margoliouth, pointing out that the Armenian present infinitive is used here for the perfect, approves of this rendering.

The addition of 5&nbsp;days (not&nbsp;6, as above) to the short year of 360&nbsp;days was made long before the Hyksôs age: it goes back to at least the Pyramid Age, and probably earlier. The introduction of the calendar, making an artificial reconciliation of the lunar and solar years, perhaps as early as 4236&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span>, is believed to give the earliest fixed date in human history: see V.&nbsp;Gordon Childe, <i>New Light on the Most Ancient East</i>, 1934, pp&nbsp;5&nbsp;f.

Rapsês: doubtless an error for Rampsês. There is confusion here: the grandfather is Ramessês&nbsp;II. See Meyer (<i>Aeg.

According to Meyer (<i>Aeg. Chron.</i> p77), this section with its identification of Osarsêph and Moses is due to an
