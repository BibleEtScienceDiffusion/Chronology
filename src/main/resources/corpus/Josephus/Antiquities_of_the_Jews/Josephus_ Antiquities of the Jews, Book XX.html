Chapter 1.</p>
<p class="contents">
A sedition of the <i>Philadelphians</i> against the <i>Jews</i>. And also
concerning the vestments of the High Priest.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.1">1.</a> [A.D. 44–45.] <span class="smallcaps">Upon the death of King Agrippa,</span> which we have related in the foregoing book, Claudius Cesar sent Cassius Longinus, as successor to Marcus; out of regard to the memory of King Agrippa; who had often desired of him by letters, while he was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea, and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders at a village called <i>Mia</i>, that was filled with men of a warlike temper. For the Jews of Perea had taken up arms, without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed many of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure, it provoked him very much, that they had <a id="page633">not</a> left the determination of the matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any wrong: but had rashly taken up arms against them. [A.D. 45.] So he seized upon three of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and ordered them to be bound; and afterward had one of them slain, whose name was Hannibal: and he banished the other two, Amram, and Eleazar. Tholomy also, the archrobber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and slain: but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians. And, indeed from that time Judea was cleared of robberies, by the care and providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the High Priests, and the principal citizens of Jerusalem; and this at the commands of the Emperor; and admonished them, that they should lay up the long garment, and the sacred vestment which it is customary for no body but the High Priest to wear, in the tower of Antonia: that it might be under the power of the Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what he had said; but desired Fadus however, and Longinus, (which last was come to Jerusalem; and had brought a great army with him, out of a fear that the [rigid] injunctions of Fadus should force the Jews to rebel;) that they might, in the first place, have leave to send ambassadors to Cesar; to petition him that they may have the holy vestments under their own power: and that, in the next place, they would tarry till they knew what answer Claudius would give to that their request. So they replyed, that they would give them leave to send their ambassadors; provided they would give them their sons as pledges [for their peaceable behaviour.] And when they had agreed so to do, and had given them the pledges they desired, the ambassadors were sent accordingly. But when, upon their coming to Rome, Agrippa junior, the son of the deceased, understood the reason why they came: for he dwelt with Claudius Cesar, as we said before;<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_1" id="b1"><sup>1</sup></a> he besought Cesar to grant the Jews their request about the holy vestments, and to send a message to Fadus accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.2">2.</a> Hereupon Claudius called for the ambassadors; and told them, that “He granted their request:” and bad them to return their thanks to Agrippa for this favour; which had been bestowed on them upon his intreaty: and, besides these answers of his, he sent the following letter by them. “Claudius Cesar, Germanicus, tribune of the people the fifth time; and designated consul the fourth time; and imperator the tenth time; the father of his countrey; to the magistrates, senate, and people, and whole nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting. Upon the presentation of your ambassadors to me by Agrippa, my friend; whom I have brought up, and have now with me; and who is a person of very great piety; who are come to give me thanks for the care I have taken of your nation, and to intreat me, in an earnest and obliging manner, that they may have the holy vestments, with the crown belonging to them, under their power: I grant their request: as that excellent person Vitellius, who is very dear to me, had done before. And I have complied with your desire; in the first place out of regard to that piety which I profess; and because I would have every one worship God according to the laws of their own countrey. And this I do also because I shall hereby highly gratify King Herod, and Agrippa junior; whose sacred regards to me, and earnest good will to you, I am well acquainted with: and with whom I have the greatest friendship; and whom I highly esteem, and look on as persons of the best character. Now I have written about these affairs to Cuspius Fadus my procurator. The names of those that brought me your letter are, Cornelius, the son of Cero; Trypho, the son of Theudio; Dorotheus, the son of Nathaniel; and John, the son of John. This letter is dated before the fourth of the calends of July, when Rufus and Pompeius Sylvanus are consuls.”</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.3">3.</a> Herod also, the brother of the deceased Agrippa, who was then possessed of the royal authority over Chalcis, petitioned Claudius Cesar for the authority over the temple, and the money of the sacred treasure, and the choice of the High Priests: and obtained all that he petitioned for. So that after that time this authority continued among all his descendants till the end of the war.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.1a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.1b">(1)</a> Accordingly Herod removed the last High Priest, called Cantheras; and bestowed that dignity on his successor Joseph, the son of Camus.</p>
<p class="chapter" id="chap2">
Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="contents">
<a id="page634">How</a> <i>Helena</i>, the Queen of <i>Adiabene</i>, and her son <i>Izates</i> embraced the Jewish religion. And how <i>Helena</i> supplied the poor with corn, when there was a great famine at <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.1">1.</a> [A.D. 45.] <span class="smallcaps">About this time it was</span> that Helena, queen of Adiabene; and her son Izates changed their course of life, and embraced the Jewish customs: and this on the occasion following.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.2a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.2b">(2)</a> Monobazus, the King of Adiabene, who had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and took her to be his wife; and begat her with child. But as he was in bed with her one night, he laid his hand upon his wives belly, and fell asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his wives belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein: which, by God’s providence, would be safely born, and have an happy end. This voice put him into disorder. So he awaked immediately, and told the story to his wife. And when his son was born, he called him Izates. He had indeed Monobazus his elder brother by Helena also; as he had other sons by other wives besides. Yet did he openly place all his affections on this his only begotten son Izates.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.3a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.3b">(3)</a> Which was the origin of that envy which his other brethren, by the same father, bore to him: while on this account they hated him more and more; and were all under great affliction that their father should prefer Izates before them. Now although their father were very sensible of these their passions, yet did he forgive them; as not indulging those passions out of an ill disposition, but out of a desire each of them had to be beloved by their father. However, he sent Izates, with many presents, to Abennerig, the King of Charax-Spasini, and that out of the great dread he was in about him, lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren bore him: and he committed his son’s preservation to him. Upon which Abennerig gladly received the young man; and had a great affection for him; and married him to his own daughter, whose name was <i>Samacha</i>. He also bestowed a countrey upon him, from which he received large revenues.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.2">2.</a> But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little time to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he died. So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate manner, and bestowed on him the countrey called <i>Carræ</i>. It was a soil that bare <i>amomum</i> in great plenty. There are also in it the remains of that ark, wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge; and where they are still shewn to such as are desirous to see them.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.4a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.4b">(4)</a> Accordingly Izates abode in that countrey until his father’s death. But the very day that Monobazus died, Queen Helena sent for all the grandees, and governours of the Kingdom; and for those that had the armies committed to their command: and when they were come, she made the following speech to them: “I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous Izates should succeed him in the government; and thought him worthy so to do. However, I wait your determination. For happy is he who receives a Kingdom not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages of a great many.” This she said in order to try those that were invited, and to discover their sentiments. Upon the hearing of which, they first of all paid their homage to the Queen, as their custom was: and then they said, that “They confirmed the King’s determination; and would submit to it; and they rejoiced that Izates’s father had preferred him before the rest of his brethren; as being agreeable to all their wishes. But that they were desirous first of all to slay <a id="page635">his</a> brethren, and kinsmen; that so the government might come securely to Izates. Because if they were once destroyed, all that fear would be over, which might arise from their hatred and envy to him.” Helena replyed to this, that “She returned them her thanks for their kindness to her self, and to Izates: but desired that they would however defer the execution of this slaughter of Izates’s brethren, till he should be there himself, and give his approbation to it.” So since these men had not prevailed with her, when they advised her to slay them, they exhorted her at least to keep them in bonds, till he should come; and that for their own security. They also gave her counsel to set up some one, whom she could put the greatest trust in, as a governor of the Kingdom in the mean time. So Queen Helena complyed with this counsel of theirs: and set up Monobazus, the eldest son, to be King; and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his father’s ring, with its signet: as also the ornament which they call <i>Sampser</i>:<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_2" id="b2"><sup>2</sup></a> and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the Kingdom, till his brother should come. Who came suddenly, upon hearing that his father was dead: and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the government to him.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.3">3.</a> Now during the time Izates abode at Charax Spasini, a certain Jewish merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women, that belonged to the King, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. He moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him in like manner to embrace that religion. He also, at the earnest intreaty of Izates, accompanyed him, when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene. It also happened, that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew, and went over to them. But when Izates had taken the Kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there saw his brethren, and other kinsmen in bonds; he was displeased at it. And as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison them; but still thought it an hazzardous thing for to let them have their liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered them; he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to Claudius Cesar: and sent the others to Artabanus, the King of Parthia, with the like intentions.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.4">4.</a> And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely. And as he supposed that he could not he thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavoured to hinder him from doing it; and said to him; that “This thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a King, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects: when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew.” This it was that she said to him: and for the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he related what she had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said: and when he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complyed with them, he went away from him, and said, that “He was afraid lest such an action being once become publick to all, he should himself be in danger of punishment; for having been the occasion of it; and having been the King’s instructor in actions that were of ill reputation: and he said, that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law intirely: which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects.” So the King at that time complyed with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew, that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar; and who was esteemed very skilful in the learning of his countrey; persuaded him to do the thing. For as he entred into his palace to salute him, and found him reading the law of Moses, he said to him, “Thou dost not consider, O King, that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws; and art injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised.] For thou oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they injoin thee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now.” When the King had heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer: but retired to another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do. He then sent <a id="page636">for</a> his mother, and Ananias his tutor; and informed them that he had done the thing. Upon which they were presently struck with astonishment, and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured, and the King should hazaard the loss of his Kingdom: while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazzard, because they would be supposed the occasion of his so doing. But it was God himself who hindred what they feared from taking effect. For he preserved both Izates himself, and his sons, when they fell into many dangers; and procured their deliverance, when it seemed to be impossible; and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their faith upon him only.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.5a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.5b">(5)</a> But these events we shall relate hereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.5">5.</a> But as to Helena, the King’s mother, when she saw that the affairs of Izates’s Kingdom were in peace; and that her son was an happy man, and admired among all men, and even among foreigners, by the means of God’s providence over him; she had a mind to go to the city Jerusalem, in order to worship at that temple of God which was so very famous among all men; and to offer her thank offerings there. So she desired her son to give her leave to go thither. Upon which he gave his consent to what she desired very willingly; and made great preparation for her dismission; and gave her a great deal of money; and she went down to the city Jerusalem; her son conducting her on her journey a great way. Now her coming was of very great advantage to the people of Jerusalem. For whereas a famine did oppress them at that time, and many people died for want of what was necessary to procure food withal; Queen Helena sent some of her servants to Alexandria, with money to buy a great quantity of corn; and others of them to Cyprus, to bring a cargo of dried figs. And as soon as they were come back, and had brought those provisions; which was done very quickly; she distributed food to those that were in want of it: and left a most excellent memorial behind her of this benefaction, which she bestowed on our whole nation. And when her son Izates was informed of this famine, he sent great sums of money to the principal men in Jerusalem. However what favours this Queen and King conferred upon our city Jerusalem shall be farther related hereafter.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.6a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.6b">(6)</a></p>
<p class="chapter" id="chap3">
Chapter 3.</p>
<p class="contents">
How <i>Artabanus</i>, the King of <i>Parthia</i>, out of fear of the secret contrivances of his subjects against him, went to <i>Izates</i>; and was by him reinstated in his government. As also how <i>Bardanes</i> his son, denounced war against <i>Izates</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S3.1">1.</a> [A.D. 45.] <span class="smallcaps">But now Artabanus,</span> King of the Parthians, perceiving that the governors of the provinces had framed a plot against him, did not think it safe for him to continue among them: but resolved to go to Izates: in hopes of finding some way for his preservation by his means; and, if possible, for his return to his own dominions. So he came to Izates, and brought a thousand of his kindred and servants with him; and met him upon the road: while he well knew Izates; but Izates <a id="page637">did</a> not know him. When Artabanus stood near him, and in the first place worshipped him, according to the custom; he then said to him; “O King, do not thou overlook me thy servant; nor do thou proudly reject the suit I make thee. For as I am reduced to a low estate, by the change of fortune; and of a King am become a private man; I stand in need of thy assistance. Have regard therefore unto the uncertainty of fortune: and esteem the care thou shalt take of me to be taken of thy self also. For if I be neglected, and my subjects go off unpunished, many other subjects will become the more insolent towards other Kings also.” And this speech Artabanus made with tears in his eyes; and with a dejected countenance. Now as soon as Izates heard Artabanus’s name, and saw him stand as a supplicant before him, he leaped down from his horse immediately, and said to him; “Take courage, O King. Nor be disturbed at thy present calamity, as if it were incurable. For the change of thy sad condition shall be sudden. For thou shalt find me to be more thy friend and thy assistant than thy hopes can promise thee. For I will either re­establish thee in the Kingdom of Parthia, or lose my own.”</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S3.2">2.</a> When he had said this, he set Artabanus upon his horse, and followed him on foot: in honour of a King whom he owned as greater than himself. Which when Artabanus saw, he was very uneasy at it; and sware by his present fortune and honour, that he would get down from his horse, unless Izates would get upon his horse again, and go before him. So he complyed with his desire, and leaped upon his horse: and, when he had brought him to his royal palace, he shewed him all sorts of respect, when they sat together; and he gave him the upper place at festivals also; as regarding not his present fortune, but his former dignity: and that upon this consideration also, that the changes of fortune are common to all men. He also wrote to the Parthians, to persuade them to receive Artabanus again; and gave them his right hand, and his faith, that he should forget what was past and done; and that he would undertake for this, as a mediator between them. Now the Parthians did not themselves refuse to receive him again: but pleaded that it was not now in their power so to do: because they had committed the government to another person, who had accepted of it, and whose name was <i>Cinnamus</i>: and that they were afraid lest a civil war should arise on this account. When Cinnamus understood their intentions, he wrote to Artabanus himself: for he had been brought up by him, and was of a nature good and gentle also: and desired him to put confidence in him, and to come and take his own dominions again. Accordingly Artabanus trusted him, and returned home: when Cinnamus met him, worshipped him, and saluted him as a King; and took the diadem off his own head, and put it on the head of Artabanus.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S3.3">3.</a> And thus was Artabanus, restored to his Kingdom again by the means of Izates, when he had lost it by the means of the grandees of the Kingdom. Nor was he unmindful of the benefits he had conferred upon him, but rewarded him with such honours as were of the greatest esteem among them. For he gave him leave to wear his Tiara upright; <a id="EndNote_Ant_20.7a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.7b">(7)</a> and to sleep upon a golden bed: which are privileges and marks of honour peculiar to the Kings of Parthia. He also cut off a large and fruitful countrey from the King of Armenia; and bestowed it upon him. The name of the countrey is <i>Nisibis</i>: wherein the Macedonians had formerly built that city which they called Antioch of Mygodonia. And these were the honours that were paid Izates by the King of the Parthians.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S3.4">4.</a> But in no long time, Artabanus died, and left his Kingdom to his son Bardanes. Now this Bardanes came to Izates, and would have persuaded him to join him with his army, and to assist him in the war he was preparing to make with the Romans: but he could not prevail with him. For Izates so well knew the strength and good fortune of the Romans, that he took Bardanes to attempt what was impossible to be done. And having besides sent his sons, five in number, and they but young also, to learn accurately the language of our nation; together with our learning: as well as he had sent his mother to worship at our temple, as I have said already: was the more backward to a complyance; and restrained Bardanes: telling him perpetually of the great armies and famous actions of the Romans: and thought thereby to terrify him, and desired thereby to hinder him from that expedition. But the Parthian King was provoked at this his behaviour; and denounced war immediately against Izates. Yet did he gain no advantage by this war; because God cut off all <a id="page638">his</a> hopes therein. For the Parthians, perceiving Bardanes’s intentions, and how he had determined to make war with the Romans, slew him; and gave his Kingdom to his brother Gotarzes. He also, in no long time, perished by a plot made against him; and Vologases his brother succeeded him.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.8a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.8b">(8)</a> Who committed two of his provinces to two of his brothers, by the same father; that of the Medes, to the elder, Pacorus; and Armenia to the younger Tiridates.</p>
<p class="chapter" id="chap4">
Chapter 4.</p>
<p class="contents">
How <i>Izates</i> was betrayed by his own subjects, and fought against by the <i>Arabians</i>. And how <i>Izates</i>, by the providence of God, was delivered out of their hands.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S4.1">1.</a> [A.D. 45.] <span class="smallcaps">Now when the King’s brother</span> Monobazus and his other kindred, saw how Izates, by his piety to God, was become greatly esteemed by all men; they also had a desire to leave the religion of their countrey, and to embrace the customs of the Jews. But that act of theirs was discovered by Izates’s subjects. Whereupon the grandees were much displeased, and could not contain their anger at them: but had an intention, when they should find a proper opportunity, to inflict a punishment upon them. Accordingly they wrote to Abia, King of the Arabians; and promised him great sums of money, if he would make an expedition against their King: and they farther promised him, that, on the first onset, they would desert their King; because they were desirous to punish him, by reason of the hatred he had to their religious worship. Then they obliged themselves by oaths to be faithful to each other; and desired that he would make haste in this design. The King of Arabia complyed with their desires; and brought a great army into the field, and marched against Izates. And in the beginning of the first onset, and before they came to a close fight; those grandees, as if they had a pannick terror upon them, all deserted Izates, as they had agreed to do; and, turning their backs upon their enemies, ran away. Yet was not Izates dismaid at this: but when he understood that the grandees had betrayed him, he also retired into his camp; and made inquiry into the matter: and as soon as he knew who they were that made this conspiracy with the King of Arabia, he cut off those that were found guilty: and renewing the fight on the next day, he slew the greatest part of his enemies; and forced all the rest to betake themselves to flight. He also pursued their King, and drove him into a fortress called <i>Arsamus</i>; and following on the siege vigorously, he took that fortress. And when he had plundered it of all the prey that was in it, which was not small, he returned to Adiabene. Yet did not he take Abia alive; because when he found himself encompassed on every side, he slew himself.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S4.2">2.</a> But although the grandees of Adiabene had failed in their first attempt, as being delivered up by God into their King’s hands; yet would they not even then be quiet: but wrote again to Vologases, who was then King of Parthia, and desired that he would kill Izates; and set over them some other potentate, who should be of a Parthian family. For they said, that “They hated their own King for abrogating the laws of their fore-fathers, and embracing foreign customs.” When the King of Parthia heard this, he boldly made war upon Izates: and as he had no just pretence for this war, he sent to him, and demanded back those honourable privileges which had been bestowed on him by his father, and threatened, on his refusal, to make war upon him. Upon hearing of this, Izates was under no small trouble of mind: as thinking it would be a reproach upon him to appear to resign those privileges that had been bestowed upon him; out of cowardice. Yet because he knew, that though the King of Parthia should receive back those honours, yet would he not be quiet, he resolved to commit himself to God his protector, in the present danger he was in of his life. And as he esteemed him to be his principal assistant, he intrusted his children and his wives to a very strong fortress; and laid up his corn in his citadels; and set the hay and the grass on fire. And when he had thus put things in order, as well as he could, he awaited the coming of the enemy. And when the King of Parthia was come, with a great army of footmen and horsemen, which he did sooner <a id="page639">than</a> was expected (for he marched in great haste;) and had cast up a bank at the river that parted Adiabene from Media, Izates also pitched his camp not far off: having with him six thousand horsemen. But there came a messenger to Izates, sent by the King of Parthia, who told him, “How large his dominions were; as reaching from the river Euphrates, to Bactria: and enumerated that King’s subjects.He also threatened him, that he should be punished, as a person ungrateful to his lords: and said, that the God whom he worshipped could not deliver him out of the King’s hands.” When the messenger had delivered this his message, Izates replyed, that “He knew the King of Parthia’s power was much greater than his own: but that he knew also that God was much more powerful than all men.” And when he had returned him this answer, he betook himself to make supplication to God; and threw himself upon the ground; and put ashes upon his head; in testimony of his confusion: and fasted, together with his wives and children.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.9a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.9b">(9)</a> When he called upon God, and said, “O Lord and Governor, if I have not in vain committed myself to thy goodness, but have justly determined that thou only art the Lord and principal of all beings; come now to my assistance; and defend me from my enemies: not only on my own account, but on account of their insolent behaviour with regard to thy power: while they have not feared to lift up their proud and arrogant tongue against thee.” Thus did he lament and bemoan himself, with tears in his eyes. Whereupon God heard his prayer. And immediately that very night, Vologases received letters: the contents of which were these; that a great band of Dahæ and Sacæ, despising him, now he was gone so long a journey from home, had made an expedition, and laid Parthia waste: so that he [was forced to] retire back, without doing any thing. And thus it was that Izates escaped the threatenings of the Parthians, by the providence of God.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S4.3">3.</a> It was not long ere Izates died: when he had compleated fifty five years of his life, and had ruled his Kingdom twenty four years. He left behind him twenty four sons, and twenty four daughters. However he gave order that his brother Monobazus should succeed in the government: thereby requiting him, because while he was himself absent, after their father’s death, he had faithfully preserved the government for him. But when Helena his mother heard of her son’s death, she was in great heaviness; as was but natural upon her loss of such a most dutiful son. Yet was it a comfort to her, that she heard the succession came to her eldest son. Accordingly she went to him in haste. And when she was come into Adiabene, she did not long outlive her son Izates. But Monobazus sent her bones, as well as those of Izates his brother, to Jerusalem; and gave order that they should be buried at the pyramids, which their mother had erected. They were three in number; and distant no more than three furlongs from the city Jerusalem.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.10a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.10b">(10)</a> But for the actions of Monobazus the King, which he did during the rest of his life. we will relate them hereafter.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_3" id="b3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class="contents">
Concerning <i>Theudas</i>; and the sons of <i>Judas</i>, the <i>Galilean</i>. As also what calamity fell upon the <i>Jews</i> on the day of the passover.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S5.1">1.</a> [A.D. 46.] <span class="smallcaps">Now it came to pass,</span> while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain magician, whose name was <i>Theudas</i>,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.11a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.11b">(10)</a> persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan. For he told them he was a prophet: and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, <a id="page640">and</a> afford them an easy passage over it. And many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt: but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. Who falling upon them unexpectedly, slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, and cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem. This was what befel the Jews in the time of Cuspius Fadus’s government.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S5.2">2.</a> [A.D. 47.] Then came Tiberius Alexander, as successor to Fadus. He was the son of Alexander, the alabarch of Alexandria: which Alexander was a principal person among all his contemporaries, both for his family, and wealth. He was also more eminent for his piety than this his son Alexander: for he did not continue in the religion of his countrey. Under these procurators that great famine happened in Judea, in which Queen Helena bought corn in Egypt, at a great expence, and distributed it to those that were in want: as I have related already. And besides this, the sons of Judas of Galilee were now slain: I mean of that Judas, who caused the people to revolt, when Cyrenius came to take an account of the estates of the Jews; as we have shewed in a foregoing book.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_4" id="b4"><sup>4</sup></a> The names of those sons were <i>James</i> and <i>Simon</i>: whom Alexander commanded to be crucified. [A.D. 48.] But now Herod King of Chalcis, removed Joseph, the son of Camydus, from the High Priesthood; and made Ananias, the son of Nebedus, his successor. And now it was, that Cumanus came as successor to Tiberius Alexander: as also that Herod, brother of Agrippa, the great King, departed this life: in the eighth year of the reign of Claudius Cesar. He left behind him three sons; Aristobulus, whom he had by his first wife, with Bernicianus, and Hyrcanus; both whom he had by Bernice, his brother’s daughter. But Claudius Cesar bestowed his dominions on Agrippa junior.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S5.3">3.</a> [A.D. 49.] Now while the Jewish affairs were under the administration of Cumanus, there happened a great tumult at the city of Jerusalem; and many of the Jews perished therein. But I shall first explain the occasion whence it was derived. When that feast, which is called the passover, was at hand: at which time our custom is to use unleavened bread: and a great multitude was gathered together from all parts to that feast; Cumanus was afraid lest some attempt of innovation should then be made by them. So he ordered that one regiment of the army should take their arms, and stand in the temple cloisters; to repress any attempts of innovation, if perchance any such should begin. And this was no more than what the former procurators of Judea did at such festivals. But on the fourth day of the feast, a certain soldier let down his breeches, and exposed his privy members to the multitude. Which put those that saw him into a furious rage; and made them cry out, that this impious action was not done to reproach them, but God himself. Nay some of them reproached Cumanus, and pretended that the soldier was set on by him. Which when Cumanus heard, he was also himself not a little provoked at such reproaches laid upon him. Yet did he exhort them to leave off such seditious attempts; and not to raise a tumult at the festival. But when he could not induce them to be quiet: for they still went on in their reproaches to him: he gave order that the whole army should take their intire armour, and come to Antonia: which was a fortress, as we have said already, which overlooked the temple. But when the multitude saw the soldiers there, they were affrighted at them; and ran away hastily. But as the passages out were but narrow; and as they thought their enemies followed them; they were crouded together in their flight, and a great number were pressed to death in those narrow passages. Nor indeed was the number fewer than twenty thousand that perished in this tumult. So instead of a festival, they had at last a mournful day of it: and they all of them forgot their prayers and sacrifices; and betook themselves to lamentation and weeping. So great an affliction did the impudent obsceneness of a single soldier bring upon them.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.12a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.12b">(12)</a></p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S5.4">4.</a> [A.D. 50.] Now before this their first mourning was over, another mischief befel them also. For some of those that raised the foregoing tumult, when they were travelling along the publick road, about an hundred furlongs from the city, robbed Stephanus, a servant of Cesar’s; as he was journeying: and plundered him of all that he had with him. Which things when Cumanus heard of, he sent soldiers immediately, and <a id="page641">ordered</a> them to plunder the neighbouring villages, and to bring the most eminent persons among them in bonds to him. Now, as this devastation was making, one of the soldiers seized the laws of Moses, that lay in one of those villages; and brought them out before the eyes of all present; and tore them to pieces. And this was done with reproachful language, and much scurrility. Which things when the Jews heard of, they ran together, and that in great numbers; and came down to Cesarea, where Cumanus then was, and besought him that he would avenge, not themselves, but God himself, whose laws had been affronted. For that they could not bear to live any longer, if the laws of their forefathers must be affronted after this manner. Accordingly Cumanus, out of fear lest the multitude should go into a sedition; and by the advice of his friends also, took care that the soldier who had offered the affront to the laws should be beheaded; and thereby put a stop to the sedition which was ready to be kindled a second time.</p>

<p class="contents">
How there happened a quarrel between the <i>Jews</i> and the <i>Samaritans</i>; and how <i>Claudius</i> put an end to their differences.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S6.1">1.</a> [A.D. 52.] <span class="smallcaps">Now there arose a quarrel</span> between the Samaritans and the Jews on the occasion following. It was the custom of the Galileans, when they came to the holy city at the festivals, to take their journeys through the countrey of the Samaritans.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.13a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.13b">(13)</a> And at this time there lay in the road they took, a village that was called <i>Ginea</i>: which was situate in the limits of Samaria, and the great plain; where certain persons thereto belonging fought with the Galileans, and killed a great many of them. But when the principal of the Galileans were informed of what had been done, they came to Cumanus, and desired him to avenge the murder of those that were killed. But he was induced by the Samaritans, with money, to do nothing in the matter. Upon which the Galileans were much displeased; and persuaded the multitude of the Jews to betake themselves to arms, and to regain their liberty: saying, that “Slavery was in it self a bitter thing; but that when it was joined with direct injuries, it was perfectly intolerable.” And when their principal men endeavoured to pacify them, and promised to endeavour to persuade Cumanus to avenge those that were killed; they would not hearken to them; but took their weapons, and intreated the assistance of Eleazar, the son of Dineus, a robber, who had many years made his abode in the mountains. With which assistance they plundered many villages of the Samaritans. When Cumanus heard of this action of theirs, he took the band of Sebaste, with four regiments of footmen, and armed the Samaritans, and marched out against the Jews, and caught them, and slew many of them, and took a greater number of them alive. Whereupon those that were the most eminent persons at Jerusalem; and that both in regard to the respect that was paid them, and the families they were of; as soon as they saw to what an height things were gone, put on sackcloth, and heaped ashes upon their heads; and by all possible means besought the seditious, and persuaded them that they would set before their eyes, the utter subversion of their countrey; the conflagration of their temple; and the slavery of themselves, their wives, and children,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.14a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.14b">(14)</a> which would be the consequences of what they were doing; and would alter their minds; would cast away their weapons; and for the future be quiet, and return to their own homes. These persuasions of theirs prevailed upon them. So the people dispersed themselves; and the robbers went away again to their places of strength. And after this time all Judea was over­run with robberies.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S6.2">2.</a> But the principal of the Samaritans went to Ummidius Quadratus, the president of Syria, who at that time was at Tyre; and accused the Jews of setting their <a id="page642">villages</a> on fire, and plundering them: and said withal, that “They were not so much displeased at what they had suffered, as they were at the contempt thereby shewed the Romans: while if they had received any injury, they ought to have made them the judges of what had been done; and not presently to make such devastation as if they had not the Romans for their governors. On which account they came to him in order to obtain that vengeance they wanted.” This was the accusation which the Samaritans brought against the Jews. But the Jews affirmed that the Samaritans were the authors of this tumult, and fighting; and that, in the first place, Cumanus had been corrupted by their gifts; and passed over the murder of those that were slain in silence. Which allegations when Quadratus heard, he put off the hearing of the cause; and promised that he would give sentence when he should come into Judea, and should have a more exact knowledge of the truth of that matter. So these men went away without success. Yet was it not long ere Quadratus came to Samaria. Where, upon hearing the cause, he supposed that the Samaritans were the authors of that disturbance. But when he was informed that certain of the Jews were making innovations, he ordered those to be crucified whom Cumanus had taken captives. From whence he came to a certain village called <i>Lydda</i>, which was not less than a city in largeness; and there heard the Samaritan cause a second time, before his tribunal; and there learned from a certain Samaritan, that one of the chief of the Jews, whose name was <i>Dortus</i>, and some other innovators with him, four in number, persuaded the multitude to a revolt from the Romans: whom Quadratus ordered to be put to death. But still he sent away Ananias the High Priest, and Ananus the commander [of the temple,] in bonds to Rome; to give an account of what they had done to Claudius Cesar. He also ordered the principal men, both of the Samaritans, and of the Jews; as also Cumanus, the procurator, and Celer the tribune, to go to Italy, to the Emperor; that he might hear their cause, and determine their differences one with another. But he came again to the city of Jerusalem, out of his fear that the multitude of the Jews should attempt some innovations. But he found the city in a peaceable state, and celebrating one of the usual festivals of their countrey to God.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_5" id="b5"><sup>5</sup></a> So he believed that they would not attempt any innovations; and left them at the celebration of the festival, and returned to Antioch.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S6.3">3.</a> Now Cumanus, and the principal of the Samaritans, who were sent to Rome, had a day appointed them by the Emperor, whereon they were to have pleaded their cause about the quarrels they had one with another. But now Cesar’s freed men, and his friends, were very zealous on the behalf of Cumanus, and the Samaritans. And they had prevailed over the Jews, unless Agrippa junior, who was then at Rome, had seen the principal of the Jews hard set; and had earnestly intreated Agrippina, the Emperor’s wife, to persuade her husband to hear the cause, so as was agreeable to his justice; and to condemn those to be punished who were really the authors of this revolt from the Roman government. Whereupon Claudius was so well disposed before­hand, that when he had heard the cause, and found that the Samaritans had been the ringleaders in those mischievous doings, he gave order that those who came up to him should be slain; and that Cumanus should be banished. He also gave order that Celer, the tribune, should be carried back to Jerusalem; and should be drawn through the city, in the sight of all the people, and then should be slain.</p>

<p class="contents">
<i>Felix</i> is made Procurator of <i>Judea</i>. As also concerning <i>Agrippa</i> junior, and his sisters.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S7.1">1.</a> [A.D. 53.] <span class="smallcaps">So Claudius sent Felix,</span> the brother of Pallans, to take care of the affairs of Judea. And when he had already completed the twelfth year of his reign, he bestowed upon Agrippa the tetrarchy of Philip, and Batanea: and added thereto Trachonitis, with Abila. Which last had been the tetrarchy of Lysanias. But he took from him Chalcis; when he had been governor thereof four years. And when Agrippa had received these countries, as the gift of Cesar, he gave his sister Drusilla in marriage to Azizus, King of Emesa: upon his consent to be circumcised. For Epiphanes, the son of King Antiochus, had refused to marry her; because after he <a id="page643">had</a> promised her father formerly to come over to the Jewish religion, he would not now perform that promise. He also gave Mariamne in marriage to Archelaus, the son of Helcias: to whom she had been betrothed formerly by Agrippa her father: from which marriage was derived a daughter, whose name was <i>Bernice</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S7.2">2.</a> But for the marriage of Drusilla with Azizus, it was in no long time afterward dissolved, upon the following occasion. While Felix was procurator of Judea, he saw this Drusilla; and fell in love with her: for she did indeed exceed all other women in beauty: and he sent to her a person whose name was Simon,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.15a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.15b">(15)</a> one of his friends, a Jew he was, and by birth a Cypriot: and one who pretended to be a magician, and endeavoured to persuade her to forsake her present husband, and marry him: and promised that if she would not refuse him, he would make her a happy woman. Accordingly she acted ill; and because she was desirous to avoid her sister Bernice’s envy; for she was very ill treated by her on account of her beauty; was prevailed upon to transgress the laws of her fore­fathers, and to marry Felix: and when he had had a son by her, he named him Agrippa. But after what manner that young man, with his wife, perished at the conflagration of the mountain Vesuvius,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.16a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.16b">(16)</a> in the days of Titus Cesar, shall be related hereafter.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_6" id="b6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S7.3">3.</a> But as for Bernice, she lived a widow a long while after the death of Herod [King of Chalcis]: who was both her husband, and her uncle: but when the report went that she had criminal conversation with her brother [Agrippa junior], she persuaded Polemo, who was King of Cilicia, to be circumcised, and to marry her: as supposing that by this means she should prove those calumnies upon her to be false. And Polemo was prevailed upon; and that chiefly on account of her riches. Yet did not this matrimony endure long. Bsut Bernice left Polemo; and, as was said, with impure intentions. So he forsook at once this matrimony, and the Jewish religion. And at the same time Mariamne put away Archelaus; and was married to Demetrius, the principal man among the Alexandrian Jews, both for his family, and his wealth And indeed he was then their Alabarch. So she named her son, which she had by him, <i>Agrippinus</i>.

<p class="contents">
After what manner, upon the death of <i>Claudius</i>, <i>Nero</i> succeeded in the government: as also what barbarous things he did. Concerning the robbers, murderers, and impostors that arose, while <i>Felix</i> and <i>Festus</i> were procurators of <i>Judea</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.1">1.</a> [A.D. 54.] <span class="smallcaps">Now Claudius Cesar died</span> when he had reigned thirteen years, eight months, and twenty days.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.17a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.17b">(17)</a> and a report went about, that he was poisoned by his wife Agrippina. Her father was Germanicus, the brother of Cesar. Her husband was Domitius Ænobarbus, one of the most illustrious persons that was in the city of <a id="page644">Rome.</a> After whose death, and her own long continuance in widowhood, Claudius took her to wife. She brought along with her a son, Domitius, of the same name with his father. He had before this slain his wife Messalina, out of jealousy: by whom he had his children Britannicus and Octavia. Their eldest sister was Antonia: whom he had by Pelina, his first wife. He also married Octavia to <i>Nero</i>; for that was the name that Cesar gave him afterward, upon his adopting him for his son.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.2">2.</a> But now Agrippina was afraid, lest when Britannicus should come to man’s estate, he should succeed his father in the government: and desired to seize upon the principality beforehand for her own son [Nero], upon which the report went, that she thence compassed the death of Claudius. Accordingly she sent Burrhus, the general of the army immediately; and with him the tribunes; and such also of the freed men as were of the greatest authority, to bring Nero away into the camp; and to salute him Emperor. And when Nero had thus obtained the government, he got Britannicus to be so poisoned, that the multitude should not perceive it: although he publickly put his own mother to death, not long afterward. Making her this requital, not only for being born of her, but for bringing it so about by her contrivances, that he obtained the Roman Empire. He also slew Octavia, his own wife, and many other illustrious persons, under this pretence, that they plotted against him.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.3">3.</a> But I omit any farther discourse about these affairs. For there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero. Some of which have departed from the truth of facts, out of favour; as having received benefits from him. While others, out of hatred to him, and the great ill will which they bare him, have so impudently raved against him with their lies, that they justly deserve to be condemned. Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero: since they have not, in their writings, preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time: even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred: since those writers lived a long time after them. But as to these that have no regard to truth, they may write as they please. For in that they take delight. But as to our selves, who have made truth our direct aim, we shall briefly touch upon what only belongs remotely to this undertaking: but shall relate what hath happened to us Jews with great accuracy: and shall not grudge our pains in giving an account both of the calamities we have suffered, and of the crimes we have been guilty of. I will now therefore return to the relation of our own affairs.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.4">4.</a> [A.D. 54.] For in the first year of the reign of Nero, upon the death of Azizus, King of Emesa, Söemus his brother&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.18a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.18b">(18)</a> succeeded in his Kingdom: and Aristobulus, the son of Herod, King of Chalcis, was intrusted by Nero with the government of the lesser Armenia. Cesar also bestowed upon Agrippa a certain part of Galilee, Tiberias, and Taricheæ:&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.19a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.19b">(19)</a> and ordered them to submit to his jurisdiction. He gave him also Julias, a city of Perea; with fourteen villages that lay about it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.5">5.</a> Now as for the affairs of the Jews, they grew worse and worse continually, for the countrey was again filled with robberies; and impostors who deluded the multitude. Yet did Felix catch and put to death many of those impostors every day; together with the robbers. He also caught Eleazar, the son of Dineas, who had gotten together a company of robbers: and this he did by treachery. For he gave him assurance that he should suffer no harm, and thereby persuaded him to come to him. But when he came he bound him, and sent him to Rome. Felix also bore an ill will to Jonathan the High Priest; because he frequently gave him admonitions about governing the Jewish affairs better than he did;<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_8" id="b8"><sup>8</sup></a> lest he should himself have complaints made of him by the multitude: since he it was who had desired Cesar to send him as procurator of Judea. So Felix contrived a method whereby he might get rid of him, now he was become so continually troublesome to him. For such continual admonitions are grievous to those who are disposed to act unjustly. Where­fore Felix persuaded one of Jonathan’s most faithful friends, a citizen of Jerusalem, <a id="page645">whose</a> name was <i>Doras</i>, to bring the robbers upon Jonathan, in order to kill him. And this he did by promising to give him a great deal of money for so doing. Doras complyed with the proposal; and contrived matters so, that the robbers might murder him after the following manner. <!--text has "following manger"--> Certain of those robbers went up to the city, as if they were going to worship God; while they had daggers under their garments; and by thus mingling themselves among the multitude, they slew Jonathan.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.20a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.20b">(20)</a> And as this murder was never avenged, the robbers went up with the greatest security at the festivals after this time: and having weapons concealed in like manner as before, and mingling themselves among the multitude, they slew certain of their own enemies, and were subservient to other men for money; and slew others not only in remote parts of the city, but in the temple it self also. For they had the boldness to murder men there, without thinking of the impiety of which they were guilty. And this seems to me to have been the reason why God, out of his hatred of these men’s wickedness, rejected our city: and as for the temple, he no longer esteemed it sufficiently pure for him to inhabit therein: but brought the Romans upon us, and threw a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us our wives and children slavery: as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.6">6.</a> [A.D. 55.] These works that were done by the robbers, filled the city with all sorts of impiety. And now these impostors and deceivers persuaded the multitude to follow them into the wilderness: and pretended that they would exhibit manifest wonders and signs, that should be performed by the providence of God.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.21a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.21b">(21)</a> And many that were prevailed on by them suffered the punishments of their folly. For Felix brought them back; and then punished them. Moreover there came out of Egypt, about this time, to Jerusalem, one that said he was a prophet;&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.22a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.22b">(22)</a> and advised the multitude of the common people to go along with him to the mount of olives, as it was called; which lay over against the city, and at the distance of five furlongs. He said farther, that he would shew them from hence how, at his command, the walls of Jerusalem would fall down: and he promised them that he would procure them an entrance into the city through those walls, when they were fallen down. Now when Felix was informed of these things, he ordered his soldiers to take their weapons, and came against them with a great number of horsemen and footmen, from Jerusalem; and attacked the Egyptian, and the people that were with him. <a id="page646">He</a> also slew four hundred of them, and took two hundred alive. But the Egyptian himself escaped out of the fight; but did not appear any more. And again the robbers stirred up the people to make war with the Romans; and said, they ought not to obey them at all: and when any persons would not comply with them, they set fire to their villages, and plundred them.</p>

<a id="S8.7">7.</a> [AD. 56.] And now it was that a great sedition arose between the Jews that inhabited Cesarea, and the Syrians who dwelt there also, concerning their equal right to the privileges belonging to citizens. For the Jews claimed the pre­eminence; because Herod their King was the builder of Cesarea; and because he was by birth a Jew. Now the Syrians did not deny what was alledged about Herod. But they said, that Cesarea was formerly called Strato’s tower; and that then there was not one Jewish inhabitant. When the presidents of that countrey heard of these disorders, they caught the authors of them on both sides, and tormented them with stripes; and by that means put a stop to the disturbance for a time. But the Jewish citizens, depending on their wealth, and on that account despising the Syrians, reproached them again, and hoped to provoke them by such reproaches. However, the Syrians, though they were inferior in wealth, yet valuing themselves highly on this account, that the greatest part of the Roman soldiers that were there were either of Cesarea, or Sebaste; they also, for some time, used reproachful language to the Jews also. And thus it was, till at length they came to throwing stones at one another, and several were wounded, and fell on both sides; though still the Jews were the conquerors. But when Felix saw that this quarrel was become a kind of war, he came upon them on the sudden; and desired the Jews to desist. And when they refused so to do, he armed his soldiers, and sent them out upon them, and slew many of them, and took more of them alive: and permitted his soldiers to plunder some of the houses of the citizens, which were full of riches. Now those Jews that were more moderate, and of principal dignity among them, were afraid of themselves: and desired of Felix that he would sound a retreat to his soldiers, and spare them for the future; and afford them room for repentance for what they had done. And Felix was prevailed upon to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.8">8.</a> [A.D 57.] About this time King Agrippa gave the High Priesthood to Ismael, who was the son of Fabi. And now arose a sedition between the High Priests,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.23a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.23b">(23)</a> and the principal men of the multitude of Jerusalem: each of which got them a company of the boldest sort of men, and of those that loved innovations about them; and became leaders to them. And when they struggled together, they did it by casting reproachful words against one another; and by throwing stones also. And there was no body to reprove them: but these disorders were done after a licentious manner in the city, as if it had no government over it. And such was the impudence and boldness that had seized on the High Priests, that they had the hardiness to send their servants into the threshing floors, to take away those tythes that were due to the Priests. Insomuch, that it so fell out, that the poorer sort of the priests died for want.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.24a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.24b">(24)</a> To this degree did the violence of the seditious prevail over all right and justice!</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.9">9.</a> [A.D. 58.] Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero, the principal of the Jewish inhabitants of Cesarea went up to Rome, to accuse Felix. And he had certainly been brought to punishment, unless Nero had yielded to the importunate sollicitations of his brother Pallas, who was at that time had in the greatest honour by him. Two of the principal Syrians in Cesarea persuaded Burrus,<!-- Whiston has Burrus --> who was Nero’s tutor, and secretary for his Greek epistles, by giving him a great sum of money, to disanul that equality of the Jewish privileges of citizens which they hitherto injoyed. So Burrus, by his solicitations, obtained leave of the Emperor, that an epistle should be written to that purpose. This epistle became the occasion of the following miseries that befel our nation. For when the Jews of Cesarea were informed of the contents of this epistle to the Syrians, they were more disorderly than before; till a war was kindled.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.10">10.</a> [A.D. 59.] <a id="page647">Upon</a> Festus’s coming into Judea, it happened, that Judea was afflicted by the robbers: while all the villages were set on fire, and plundered by them. And then it was that the Sicarii, as they were called, who were robbers, grew numerous. They made use of small swords, not much different in length from the Persian <i>Acinacæ</i>, but somewhat crooked, and like the Roman <i>Sicae</i>, [or sickles] as they were called. And from these weapons these robbers got their denomination: and with these weapons they slew a great many. For they mingled themselves among the multitude at their festivals, when they were come up in crouds from all parts to the city to worship God, as we said before; and easily slew those that they had a mind to slay. They also came frequently upon the villages belonging to their enemies, with their weapons, and plundered them, and set them on fire. So Festus sent forces both horsemen and footmen to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance, and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness. Accordingly those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S8.11">11.</a> [A.D. 60.] About the same time King Agrippa built himself a very large dining room in the royal palace at Jerusalem, near to the portico. Now this palace had been erected of old by the children of Asamoneus, and was situate upon an elevation, and afforded a most delightful prospect to those that had a mind to take a view of the city. Which prospect was desired by the King. And there he could lie down, and eat, and thence observe what was done in the temple. Which thing when the chief men of Jerusalem saw, they were very much displeased at it. For it was not agreeable to the institutions of our countrey or law, that what was done in the temple should be viewed by others; especially what belonged to the sacrifices. They therefore erected a wall upon the uppermost building which belonged to the inner court of the temple towards the west. Which wall, when it was built, did not only intercept the prospect of the dining room in the palace, but also of the western cloisters that belonged to the outer court of the temple also: where it was that the Romans kept guards for the temple at the festivals. At these doings both King Agrippa, and principally Festus the procurator were much displeased. And Festus ordered them to pull the wall down again. But the Jews petitioned him to give them leave to send an ambassage about this matter to Nero. For they said, they could not endure to live if any part of the temple should be demolished. And when Festus had given them leave so to do, they sent ten of their principal men to Nero: as also Ismael the High Priest, and Helcias the keeper of the sacred treasure. And when Nero had heard what they had to say, he not only forgave them what they had already done; but also gave them leave to let the wall they had built stand.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.25a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.25b">(25)</a> This was granted them in order to gratify Poppea, Nero’s wife; who was a religious woman, and had requested these favours of Nero: and who gave order to the ten ambassadors to go their way home; but retained Helcias and Ismael as hostages with her self. As soon as the King heard this news, he gave the High Priesthood to Joseph, who was called <i>Cabi</i>, the son of Simon, formerly High Priest.</p>

<p class="contents">
<a id="page648">Concerning</a> <i>Albinus</i>, under whose procuratorship <i>James</i> was slain. As also what edifices were built by <i>Agrippa</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.1">1.</a> [A.D. 61.] <span class="smallcaps">And now Cesar,</span> upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the King deprived Joseph of the High Priesthood; and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes, that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man. For he had five sons, who had all performed the office of an High Priest to God; and who had himself injoyed that dignity a long time formerly: which had never happened to any other of our High Priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the High Priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent. He was also of the sect of the Sadducees:&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.26a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.26b">(26)</a> who are very rigid in judging offenders above all the rest of the Jews: as we have already observed.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_9" id="b9"><sup>9</sup></a> When therefore Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority]. Festus was now dead; and Albinus was but upon the road. So he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus who was called Christ, whose name was James: and some others; [or, some of his companions.] And when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.27a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.27b">(27)</a> But as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done. They also sent to the King [Agrippa,] desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more: for that what he had already done was not to be justified. Nay some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria; and informed him, that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complyed with what they said; and wrote in anger to Ananus; and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done. On which account King Agrippa took the High Priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months; and made Jesus, the son of Damneus High Priest.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.2">2.</a> [A.D. 62.] Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem, he used all his endeavours and care that the countrey might be kept in peace: and this by destroying many of the Sicarii. But as for the High Priest Ananias,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.28a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.28b">(28)</a> he increased in glory every day; and this to a great degree: and had obtained the favour and esteem of the citizens in a signal manner. For he was a great hoarder up of money. He therefore cultivated the friendship of Albinus, and of the High Priest [Jesus,] by making them presents. He had also servants who were very wicked; who joined themselves to the boldest sort of the people, and went to the threshing floors, and took away the tythes that belonged to the priests by violence: and did not refrain <a id="page649">from</a> beating such as would not give these tythes to them. So the other High Priests acted in the like manner, as did those his servants, without any one’s being able to prohibit them. So that [some of the] priests, that of old were wont to be supported with those tythes, died for want of food.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.3">3.</a> But now the Sicarii went into the city by night; just before the festival, which was now at hand;<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_10" id="b10"><sup>10</sup></a> and took the scribe belonging to the governor of the temple, whose name was Eleazar, who was the son of Ananus [Ananias] the High Priest, and bound him, and carried him away with them. After which they sent to Ananias, and said, that they would send the scribe to him if he would persuade Albinus to release ten of those prisoners which he had caught of their party. So Ananias was plainly forced to persuade Albinus, and gained his request of him. This was the beginning of greater calamities. For the robbers perpetually contrived to catch some of Ananias’s servants: and when they had taken them alive, they would not let them go, till they thereby recovered some of their own Sicarii. And as they were again become no small number, they grew bold, and were a great affliction to the whole countrey.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.4">4.</a> About this time it was that King Agrippa built Cesarea Philippi larger than it was before: and in honour of Nero, named it <i>Neronias</i>. And when he had built a theatre at Berytus, with vast expences, he bestowed on them shews, to be exhibited every year; and spent therein many ten thousand [drachmæ.] He also gave the people a largess of corn; and distributed oil among them; and adorned the intire city with statues of his own donation; and with original images made by ancient hands. Nay he almost transferred all that was most ornamental in his own Kingdom thither. This made him more than ordinarily hated by his subjects: because he took those things away that belonged to them, to adorn a foreign city. And now Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, became the successor of Jesus, the son of Damneus, in the High Priesthood; which the King had taken from the other. On which account a sedition arose between the High Priests, with regard to one another. For they got together bodies of the boldest sort of the people; and frequently came from reproaches to throwing of stones at each other. But Ananias was too hard for the rest, by his riches; which enabled him to gain those that were most ready to receive. Costobarus also, and Saulus did themselves get together a multitude of wicked wretches; and this because they were of the royal family; and so they obtained favour among them, because of their kindred to Agrippa. But still they used violence with the people; and were very ready to plunder those that were weaker than themselves. And from that time it principally came to pass, that our city was greatly disordered; and that all things grew worse and worse among us.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.5">5.</a> [A.D. 63.] But when Albinus heard that Gessius Florus was coming to succeed him, he was desirous to appear to do somewhat that might be grateful to the people of Jerusalem. So he brought out all those prisoners who seemed to him to be most plainly worthy of death, and ordered them to be put to death accordingly. But as to those who had been put into prison, on some trifling occasions, he took money of them, and dismissed them By which means the prisons were indeed emptied; but the countrey was filled with robbers.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.6">6.</a> Now as many of the Levites,which is a tribe of ours, as were singers of hymns, persuaded the King to assemble a sanhedrim, and to give them leave to wear linen garments,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.29a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.29b">(29)</a> as well as the priests. For they said that this would be a work worthy the times of his government; that he might have a memorial of such a novelty, as being his doing. Nor did they fail of obtaining their desire. For the King, with the suffrages of those that came into the sanhedrim, granted the singers of hymns this privilege, that they might lay aside their former garments, and wear such a linen one as they desired. And as a part of this tribe ministred in the temple, he also permitted them to learn those hymns as they had besought him for. Now all this was contrary to the laws of our countrey: which, whenever they have been transgressed we have never been able to avoid the punishment of such transgressions.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S9.7">7.</a> [A.D. 63.] <a id="page650">And</a> now it was that the temple was finished.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.30a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.30b">(30)</a> So when the people saw that the workmen were unemployed, who were above eighteen thousand; and that they receiving no wages were in want, because they had earned their bread by their labours about the temple: and while they were unwilling to keep by them the treasures that were there reposited, out of fear of [their being carried away by] the Romans: and while they had a regard to the making provision for the workmen; they had a mind to expend those treasures upon them. For if any one of them did but labour for a single hour, he received his pay immediately. So they persuaded him to rebuild the eastern cloisters. These cloisters belonged to the outer court, and were situate in a deep valley, and had walls that reached four hundred cubits [in length;] and were built of square and very white stones: the length of each of which stones was twenty cubits, and their height six cubits. This was the work of King Solomon;&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_20.31a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.31b">(31)</a> who first of all built the intire temple. But King Agrippa; who had the care of the temple committed to him by Claudius Cesar; considering, that ’tis easy to demolish any building, but hard to build it up again: and that it was particularly hard to do it to these cloisters; which would require a considerable time, and great sums of money; he denied the petitioners their request about that matter. But he did not obstruct them when they desired the city might be paved with white stone. [A.D. 65.] He also deprived Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, of the High Priesthood; and gave it to Matthias, the son of Theophilus, under whom the Jews war with the Romans took its beginning.</p>

<p class="contents">
An enumeration of the High Priests.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S10.1">1.</a> <span class="smallcaps">And now I think it proper</span> and agreeable to this history to give an account of our High Priests; how they began; and who those are which are capable of that dignity; and how many of them there had been at the end of the war. In the first place therefore history informs us, that Aaron, the brother of Moses, officiated to God as an High Priest: and that, after his death, his sons succeeded him immediately: and that this dignity hath been continued down from them all to their posterity. Whence it is a custom of our countrey, that no one should take the High Priesthood of God, but he who is of the blood of Aaron: while every one that is of another stock, though he were a King, can never obtain that High Priesthood. Accordingly the number of all the High Priests from Aaron, of whom we have spoken already as of the first of them, until Phanas, who was made High Priest during the war by the seditious, was eighty three. Of whom thirteen officiated as High Priests in the wilderness; from the days of Moses, while the tabernacle was standing, until the people came into Judea, when King Solomon erected the temple to God. For at the first they held the High Priesthood till the end of their life: although afterward they had successors while they were alive. Now these thirteen, who were the descendants of two of the sons of Aaron, received this dignity by succession one after another. For their form of government was an aristocracy; and after that a monarchy; and in the third place the government was regal. Now the number of years during the rule of these thirteen, from the day when our fathers departed out of Egypt, under Moses their leader, until the building of that temple which King Solomon erected at Jerusalem, were six hundred and twelve. After those thirteen High Priests, eighteen took the High Priesthood at Jerusalem, one in succession to another, from the days of King Solomon, until Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon made an expedition against that city, and burnt the temple, and removed our nation into Babylon, and then took Josadek the High Priest captive. The times of these High Priests were four hundred and sixty six years, six months, and ten days: while the Jews were still under the regal government. But after the term of the seventy years captivity under the Babylonians, Cyrus, King of Persia sent the Jews from Babylon to their own land again; and gave them leave to rebuild their temple. At which time Jesus, the son of Josadek took the High Priesthood over the captives, when they <a id="page651">were</a> returned home. Now he and his posterity, who were in all fifteen, until King Antiochus Eupator, were under a democratical government, for four hundred and fourteen years. And then the forementioned Antiochus, and Lysias the general of his army, deprived Onias, who was also named <i>Menelaus</i>, of the High Priesthood, and slew him at Berea; and driving away the son [of Onias the third,] put Jacimus into the place of the High Priest. One that was indeed of the stock of Aaron; but not of that family of Onias. On which account Onias, who was the nephew of Onias that was dead, and bore the same name with his father, came into Egypt, and got into the friendship of Ptolemy Philometor, and Cleopatra his wife; and persuaded them to make him the High Priest of that temple which he built to God in the prefecture of Heliopolis; and this in imitation of that at Jerusalem. But as for that temple which was built in Egypt, we have spoken of it frequently already.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_11" id="b11"><sup>11</sup></a> Now when Jacimus had retained the High Priesthood three years, he died; and there was no one that succeeded him: but the city continued seven years without an High Priest. But then the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus, who had the government of the nation conferred upon them, when they had beaten the Macedonians in war, appointed Jonathan to be their High Priest: who ruled over them seven years. And when he had been slain by the treacherous contrivance of Trypho, as we have related somewhere,<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_12" id="b12"><sup>12</sup></a> Simon his brother took the High Priesthood; and when he was destroyed at a feast by the treachery of his son-in-law, his own son, whose name was Hyrcanus, succeeded him; after he had held the High Priesthood one year longer than his brother. This Hyrcanus enjoyed that dignity thirty years; and dyed an old man: leaving the succession to Judas, who was also called <i>Aristobulus</i>. Whose brother Alexander was his heir: which Judas died of a sore distemper, after he had kept the priesthood, together with the royal authority. For this Judas was the first that put on his head a diadem, for one year. And when Alexander had been both King and High Priest twenty seven years, he departed this life; and permitted his wife Alexandra to appoint him that should he High Priest. So she gave the High Priesthood to Hyrcanus: but retained the Kingdom her self, nine years; and then departed this life. The like duration [and no longer] did her son Hyrcanus injoy the High Priesthood. For after her death his brother Aristobulus fought against him, and beat him, and deprived him of his principality: and he did himself both reign, and perform the office of High Priest to God. But when he had reigned three years, and as many months, Pompey came upon him: and not only took the city of Jerusalem by force, but put him and his children in bonds, and sent them to Rome. He also restored the High Priesthood to Hyrcanus; and made him governor of the nation: but forbad him to wear a diadem. This Hyrcanus ruled, besides his first nine years, twent -four years more, when Barzapharnes and Pacorus, the generals of the Parthians, passed over Euphrates, and fought with Hyrcanus, and took him alive, and made Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, King. And when he had reigned three years and three months, Sosius and Herod besieged him, and took him. When Antony had him brought to Antioch, and slain there. Herod was then made King by the RomansL but did no longer appoint High Priests out of the family of Asamoneus; but made certain men to be so that were of no eminent families; but barely of those that were priests: excepting that he gave that dignity to Aristobulus. For when he had made this Aristobulus, the grandson of that Hyrcanus who was then taken by the Parthians, and had taken his sister Mariamne to wife, he thereby aimed to win the good will of the people, who had a kind remembrance of Hyrcanus [his grand-father.] Yet did he afterward, out of his fear lest they should all bend their inclinations to Aristobulus, put him to death: and that by contriving how to have him suffocated, as he was swimming at Jericho; as we have already related that matter.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_13" id="b13"><sup>13</sup></a> But after this man he never intrusted the High Priesthood to the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus. Archelaus also, Herod’s son, did like his father in the appointment of the High Priests: as did the Romans also, who took the government over the Jews into their hands afterward. Accordingly the number of the High Priests, from the days of Herod, until the day when Titus took the temple, and the city, and burnt them, were in all twenty eight.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#margin_note_14" id="b14"><sup>14</sup></a> The time also that belonged to them was an hundred and seven years. Some of these were the political governors of the people under the reign of Herod, and under the reign of Archelaus his son: although after their death the government became an aristocracy; and the High Priests were intrusted with a dominion over the nation. And thus much may suffice to be said concerning our High Priests.</p>

<p class="contents">
<a id="page652">Concerning</a> <i>Florus</i> the Procurator; who necessitated the <i>Jews</i>
to take up arms against the <i>Romans</i>. The conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S11.1">1.</a> [A.D. 64.] <span class="smallcaps">Now Gessius Florus,</span> who was sent as successor to Albinus, by Nero, filled Judea with abundance of miseries. He was by birth of the city of Clazomenæ; and brought along with him his wife Cleopatra: (by whose friendship with Poppea, Nero’s wife, he obtained this government:) who was no way different from him in wickedness. This Florus was so wicked, and so violent in the use of his authority, that the Jews took Albinus to have been [comparatively] their benefactor: so excessive were the mischiefs that he brought upon them. For Albinus concealed his wickedness, and was careful that it might not be discovered to all men. But Gessius Florus, as though he had been sent on purpose to shew his crimes to every body, made a pompous ostentation of them to our nation: as never omitting any sort of violence, nor any unjust sort of punishment. For he was not to be moved by pity; and never was satisfied with any degree of gain that came in his way. Nor had he any more regard to great, than to small acquisitions: but became a partner with the robbers themselves. For a great many fell then into that practice without fear, as having him for their security; and depending on him, that he would save them harmless in their particular robberies. So that there were no bounds set to the nation’s miseries, but the unhappy Jews, when they were not able to bear the devastations which the robbers made among them, were all under a necessity of leaving their own habitations, and of flying away: as hoping to dwell more easily any where else in the world among foreigners, [than in their own countrey.] And what need I say any more upon this head? since it was this Florus who necessitated us to take up arms against the Romans; while we thought it better to be destroyed at once, than by little and little. Now this war began in the second year of the government of Florus; and the twelfth year of the reign of Nero. But then what actions we were forced to do; or what miseries we were enabled to suffer, may be accurately known by such as will peruse those books which I have written about the Jewish war.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S11.2">2.</a> I shall now, therefore, make an end here of my Antiquities. After the conclusion of which events, I began to write that account of the War. And these Antiquities contain what hath been delivered down to us from the original creation of man, until the twelfth year of the reign of Nero: as to what hath befallen us Jews, as well in Egypt as in Syria, and in Palestine; and what we have suffered from the Assyrians, and Babylonians; and what afflictions the Persians, and Macedonians, and after them the Romans, have brought upon us. For I think I may say that I have composed this history with sufficient accuracy in all things. I have attempted to enumerate those High Priests that we have had, during the interval of two thousand years. I have also carried down the succession of our Kings, and related their actions and political administration, without [considerable] errors: as also the power of our monarchs; and all according to what is written in our sacred books. For this it was that I promised to do in the beginning of this history. And I am so bold as to say; now I have so compleatly perfected the work I proposed to my self to do; that no other person, whether he were a Jew, or a foreigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it, could so accurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these books. For those of my own nation freely acknowledge that I far exceed them in the learning belonging to Jews. I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks; and understand the elements of the Greek language: although I have so long accustomed my self to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness. For our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations; and so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods: because they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free men, but to as many of the servants as please to learn them. But they give him the testimony of being a wise man, who is fully acquainted with our laws; and is able to interpret their meaning. On which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavours, with great patience, to obtain <a id="page653">this</a> learning: there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein: who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.</p>
<p class="indent">

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.1a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.1b">(1)</a> Here is some error in the copies, or mistake in Josephus. For the power of appointing High Priests, after Herod King of Chalcis was dead, and Agrippa jun. was made King of Chalcis in his room, belonged to him; and he exercised the same all along till Jerusalem was destroyed, as Josephus elsewhere informs us, Chap. 8. §&nbsp;11. Chap. 9. §&nbsp;1, 4, 6, 7.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.2a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.2b">(2)</a> Concerning Monobazus, and Helena, and their son Izates, and the contents of this, and of the two next chapters, see Moses Chorenensis, pag. 132–141. and <i>Authentick Records</i>, P<sup>t</sup> II. pag 954–961. and pag 1083–1123. Only this I shall add now, which was sugested to me since I wrote those accounts, that Orosius confirms my determination, that Helena, Queen of Adiabene was not converted to the Jewish, but to the Christian Religion; and thence sent supplies to the Christians in Judea, during the famine under Claudius Cesar, L. VII. C. 6. The Talmud also has a full account of this Helena, and Monobazus; and of their great favours to the Jews; as Hudson and Reland observe upon these Chapters.</p>
<p class="note">
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.3a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.3b">(3)</a> Josephus here uses the word μονογενῆ, an <i>only begotten son</i>, for no other than one <i>best beloved</i>: as does both the Old and New Testament, I mean where there were one or more sons besides. Genesis 22:2. Hebrew 11:17. See the Note on <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-1.html#S13.1">I.13.1</a>.</p>

<p class="note">
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.5a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.5b">(5)</a> Josephus is very full and express in these three Chapters, 3. 4. and 5. in observing, how carefully divine providence preserved this Izates, King of Adiabene, and his sons; while he did what he thought was his bounden duty; notwithstanding the strongest political motives to the contrary.</p>
<p class="note">
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.6a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.6b">(6)</a> This farther account of the benefactions of Izates and Helena to the Jerusalem Jews, which Josephus here promises, is, I think, no where performed by him in his present works. But of this terrible famine itself in Judea, take Dr. Hudson’s Note here: “This, says he, is that famine foretold by Agabus Acts 11:28. which happened when Claudius was consul the fourth time: [A.D. 47.] and not that other which happened when Claudius was consul the second time, and Cæsina was his colleague, [A.D. 42.] as Scaliger says upon Eusebius, page&nbsp;174.” Now when Josephus had said a little afterward, Chap. 5. §&nbsp;2. that “Tiberius Alexander succeeded Cuspius Fadus as procurator,” he immediately subjoins, that “Under these procurators there happened a great famine in Judea.” Whence it is plain, that this famine continued for many years, on account of its duration under these two procurators. Now Fadus was not sent into Judea till after the death of King Agrippa; i.e. towards the latter end of the IV<sup>th</sup> year of Claudius [the end of A.D. 44. or beginning of 45.] So that this famine foretold by Agabus, happened upon the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> years of Claudius, [A.D. 45, 46, and 47.] as says Valesius on Euseb. II.12. Of this famine also, and Queen Helena’s supplies, and her monument, see Moses Chorenensis, pag.&nbsp;144, 145. Where it is observed in the Notes, that Pausanias mentions that her monument also [<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D5">VIII.16.5</a>: “The Hebrews have a grave, that of Helen, a native woman, in the city of Jerusalem, which the Roman Emperor razed to the ground. There is a contrivance in the grave whereby the door, which like all the grave is of stone, does not open until the year brings back the same day and the same hour. Then the mechanism, unaided, opens the door, which, after a short interval, shuts itself. This happens at that time, but should you at any other try to open the door you cannot do so; force will not open it, but only break it down.”]</p>

See Chap. 6. §&nbsp;1. However, his supplications were heard; and he was providentially delivered from that eminent danger he was in.</p>

Hist.</i> II.12. for which Dr. Hudson refers us to Valesius’s Notes upon that place. They are also mentioned by Pausanias, as hath been already noted, Chap. 2. §&nbsp;6.

This, and many more tumults and seditions, which arose at the Jewish festivals, in Josephus, illustrate that cautious procedure of the Jewish governors, when they said, Matt. 26:5. <i>Let us not take Jesus on the feast day; lest there be an uproar among the people</i>: as Reland well observes on this place. Josephus also takes notice of the same thing, <i>Of the War</i>, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/war-1.html#S4.3">I.4.3</a>.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.13a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.13b">(13)</a> This constant passage of the Galileans through the countrey of Samaria, as they went to Judea and Jerusalem, illustrates several passages in the gospels to the same purpose, as Dr. Hudson rightly observes. See Luke 17:11. John 4:4. See also Josephus in his own Life, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/autobiog.html#S52">§&nbsp;52.</a> where that journey is determined to three days.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.14a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.14b">(14)</a> Our Saviour had foretold, that the Jews rejection of his Gospel would bring upon them, among other miseries, these three; which they themselves here shew they expected would be the consequences of their present tumults and seditions. The utter subversion of their countrey: the conflagration of their temple: and the slavery of themselves, their wives, and children. See Luke 21:6. 24.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.15a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.15b">(15)</a> This Simon, a friend of Felix’s; a Jew, born in Cyprus; though he pretended to be a magician, and seems to have been wicked enough, could hardly be that famous Simon, the magician, in the Acts of the Apostles, 8:9, &amp;c. as some are ready to suppose. This Simon, mentioned in the Acts, was not properly a Jew, but a Samaritan; of the town of Gittæ, in the countrey of Samaria; as the <i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/07156.htm">VI.7.</a> The <i>Recognitions of Clement</i>, <a href="http://www.essene.com/Recognitions/Book2.htm#P1651_434327">II.6.</a> [sc. 7.] and Justin Martyr, himself born in the countrey of Samaria, <i>Apology</i>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm">I.34.</a> [sc. 26.] <!-- the text in front of me has clement II.6 and Justin I.34, but that's not right --> inform us. He was also the author, not of any ancient Jewish, but of the first Gentile heresies: as the forementioned authors assure us. So I suppose him a different person from the other. I mean this only upon the hypothesis, that Josephus were not misinformed, as to his being a Cypriot Jew. For otherwise the time, the name, the profession, and the wickedness of them both would strongly incline one to believe them the very same. As to that Drusilla, the sister of Agrippa junior, as Josephus informs us here; and a Jewess, as St. Luke informs us, Acts 24:24. whom this Simon, mentioned by Josephus, persuaded to leave her former husband, Azizus, King of Emesa, a proselyte of Justice; and to marry Felix, the Heathen procurator of Judea; Tacitus, <i>Hist.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html#9">V.9.</a> supposes her to be an Heathen, and the grand-daughter of Antonius and Cleopatra: contrary both to St. Luke, and Josephus. Now Tacitus lived somewhat too remote both as to time, and place, to be compared with either of those Jewish writers, in a matter concerning the Jews in Judea, in their own days; and concerning a sister of Agrippa junior’s, with which Agrippa Josephus was himself so well acquainted. ’Tis probable that Tacitus may say true, when he informs us, that this Felix (who had in all three wives, or Queens, as Suetonius in <i>Claudius</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#28">§&nbsp;28.</a> assures us,) did once marry such a grand­child of Antonius and Cleopatra. And finding the name of one of them to have been Drusilla, he mistook her for that other wife, whose name he did not know. [Or a simpler solution is often advocated: 2 of the 3 queens he married were named Drusilla, one the daughter of Agrippa, the other the grand­daughter of Antony and Cleopatra via her mother, Cleopatra Selene II.]</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.20a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.20b">(20)</a> This treacherous and barbarous murder of the good High Priest, Jonathan, by the contrivance of this wicked procurator, Felix, was the immediate occasion of the ensuing murders by the Sicarii or ruffians: and one great cause of the following horrid cruelties and miseries of the Jewish nation: as Josephus here supposes. Whose excellent reflexion on the gross wickedness of that nation, as the direct cause of their terrible destruction, is well worthy the attention of every Jewish and of every Christian reader. And since we are soon coming to the catalogue of the Jewish High Priests, it may not be amiss, with Reland, to insert this Jonathan among them, and to transcribe his particular catalogue of the last 28 High Priests, taken out of Josephus, and begin with Ananelus, who was made by Herod the Great.

<p class="note">
But here and elsewhere the reader must observe, that where Josephus does not set down the duration of any High Priest’s office, or government, neither have I presumed to set it down; as not pretending to know more than he did in such matters. And when Dean Prideaux ventures to set those years down, as he does all along, from such a comparative late and weak authority as that of the <i>Chronicon Alexandrinum</i>, I rather wonder at his boldness, than dare venture to follow his example. 
As for Ananus, and Joseph Caiaphas here mentioned about the middle of this catalogue, they are no other than those Annas and Caiaphas, so often mentioned in the four Gospels: and that Ananias, the son of Nebedeus, was that High Priest before whom St. Paul pleaded his own cause. Acts 24.</p>

Nor ought we to pass slightly over what Josephus here says of Annas or Ananias that he was High Priest a long time before his children were so. He was the son of Seth, and is set down first for High Priest in the foregoing catalogue, under number 9. He was made by Quirinus, and continued till Ismael the 10<sup>th</sup> in number, for about 23&nbsp;years. Which long duration of his High Priesthood, joined to the successions of his son-in-law, and five children of his own, made him a sort of perpetual High Priest: and was perhaps the occasion that former High Priests kept their titles ever afterwards. For I believe it is hardly met with before him.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-20.html#EndNote_Ant_20.33a" id="EndNote_Ant_20.33b">(33)</a> What Josephus here declares his <i>intention</i> to do, <i>if God permitted</i>, I mean to give the publick <i>again an abridgement of the Jewish War</i>; and to add <i>what befel them farther to that very day</i>, the 13<sup>th</sup> of Domitian, or A.D.&nbsp;93. is not, that I have observed, taken distinct notice of by any. Nor do we ever hear of it elsewhere, whether he performed what he now intended or not. Some of the reasons of this design of his might possibly be his observation of the many errors he had been guilty of in the two first of those VII Books of the War, which I have formerly taken notice of in the IV<sup>th</sup> Dissertation prefixed, §&nbsp;32, 33. were written when he was comparatively young, and less acquainted with the Jewish Antiquities than he now was: and in which abridgment we might have hoped to find those many passages which himself, as well as those several passages which others refer to, as written by him; but which are not extant in his present works. However, since many of his own references to what he had written elsewhere, as well as most of his own errors, belong to such early times, as could not well come into this abridgement of the Jewish War; and since none of those that quote things not now extant in his works, including himself, as well as others, ever cite any such abridgement; I am forced rather to suppose that he never did publish any such work at all: I mean as distinct from his own Life, written by himself, for an Appendix to these Antiquities; and this at least above 7 years after these Antiquities were finished: as I have already proved in the VI<sup>th</sup> Dissertation prefixed §&nbsp;3. and shall prove more distinctly in my Note upon Justus of Tiberius’s fragment, to be set down after his Life presently. Nor indeed does it appear to me, that Josephus ever published that other work here mentioned, as intended by him for the publick also; I mean the 3 or 4 Books <i>concerning God, and his essence</i>, and concerning <i>the Jewish laws; why, according to them, some things were permitted the Jews, and others prohibited</i>. Which last seems to be the same work which Josephus had also promised, <i>if God permitted</i>, at the conclusion of his Preface to these Antiquities. Nor do I suppose that he ever published any of them. The death of all his friends at court, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian; and the coming of those he had no acquaintance with to the crown, I mean Nerva and Trajan; together with his removal from Rome to Judea, with what followed it; might easily interrupt such his intentions, and prevent his publication of those works.</p>
