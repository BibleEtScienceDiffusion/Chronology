</head>
<body><h3>         The Authentic Annals Of The Early Hebrews - <br>  Is It The "Real" Book of Jasher?
</h3>It is understandable that some may feel that it is impossible or unlikely that this volume
could really be the original book of Jasher.
<p>The issue is compounded by the existence of several works by the name Sefer
Hayasher. I have in my possession a copy of <em>Sefer Hayasher - The Book Of The
Righteous</em>, edited and translated by Seymour J. Cohen. It is clearly not a book of history,
but an ethical text that was probably written in the 13th century. Its introduction cites
several other "Books of Jasher", some of which are no longer known to be in existence,
such as that by Zerahiah Ha-Yevani of the 13th century.  There is also known to have
been one written by Rabbi Jacob ben Mier of the 12th century, and one by Rabbi Jonah
ben Abraham of Gerona of the 14th century.  We are told of a work by that title from the
Amoraim period (3rd to 6th centuries) that is characterized as containing "for the most
part sayings of the sages of the first and second centuries".  So, this title has been a
popular one for rabbinical writings, but most are clearly not intended to have been
passed off as the book mentioned in the Bible.  There is one notable exception which
I will mention later.
</p><p>The first step in dealing with the question of authenticity is to simply read the book with
an open mind.  One cannot effectively investigate the matter unless he is familiar with
it.  After all, according to Solomon, "He who answers a matter before he hears it,  It is
folly and shame to him". (Proverbs 18:13).  The reader will find that it reads very much
like the Bible, except that many passages are replete with details that are not recorded
in the Bible.</p><p>There are digressions from the biblical narrative that show concurrent events in other
parts of the world.  There are chapters dealing wholly with events in Egypt or events in
Europe.  Much of this material can be recognized from other works of ancient history. 
To anyone familiar with ancient history, it will be obvious that Jasher places these events
in a radically different time period than do conventional historians.  To be sure, if Jasher
be true, there needs to be a radical alteration in the conventional interpretation of ancient
history, especially in the area of chronology.  </p><p>There is little of consequence at variance with the Bible.  There are some chronological
features that differ, but these can usually be attributed to a textual error.  Usually the
error will be resolved by reading on.  A later entry will fall into harmony with the Bible
text.  Remember that the ancient scrolls of this book were in poor condition when the
book was printed in Hebrew in 1613. It is not unlikely that some numbers could get
scrambled.</p><p>There are a couple mysterious accounts of incidents that smack of Greek or Roman
mythology, such as the story of Zepho, the grandson of Esau who slew a half human
monster in a large cave.  This account is easily recognized as the same story as that of
Theseus, who slew the minotaur.  The characters and the setting are different.  A critical
reader may object to this material, but many valid explanations are possible concerning
why this and other such events were recorded in this book.  The original author may
have simply reported those things because they were popular folklore of his day.  Such
stories are merely mentioned in passing and no significance is attached to them. 
Though one might doubt the veracity of these tales, there is nothing here that should
dissuade an objective reader from the opinion that this book is genuine.Even the most</p><p> casual reader will find Jasher enlightening.  Accounts in the Bible can be
made more lucid and easier to understand with the background of Jasher in mind.</p><p>The next issue to investigate in regard to the authenticity of this book is the two
passages which mention the book by name.  The first is Joshua 10.12-13:    </p><blockquote><small> "... and he [Joshua] said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
     and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon.  And the sun stood still, and the moon
     stayed, until the people avenged themselves upon their enemies.  Is it not written
     in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted
     not to go down about a whole day. And there was no day like that before it or
     after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of man: for the Lord fought for Israel."
</small>
</blockquote>And now compare it with the following passage in Jasher 88.63-64:   <small>  </small><blockquote><small>"...and Joshua said in the sight of all the people, Sun, stand thou still upon
     Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon, until the nation shall have
     revenged itself upon its enemies... And the sun stood still in the midst of the
     heavens, and it stood still six and thirty moments, and the moon also stood still
     and hastened not to go down a whole day.  And there was no day like that before
     it or after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of man, for the Lord fought for
     Israel."</small></blockquote>
A comparison of the text preceding also shows a high degree of correlation, indicating
that much more than a couple of verses was probably quoted by the Bible writer.
<p>A second mention of the Book of Jasher occurs in II Samuel 1.17.  In contrast, this
incident is not a direct quotation of a historical event from Jasher, as is the case in
Joshua.  Jasher's narrative ends long before the time of David.  However, as part of his
lamentation over the death of Saul and Jonathan, David referred to a comment by Jacob
that is quoted in the Book of Jasher. He said:</p><blockquote><small>  "Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: Behold it is written in the book of Jasher." </small></blockquote>David is referring to the dying words of Jacob to Judah in Jasher 56:9,<blockquote>    <small> "...only teach thy sons the use of the bow and all weapons of war, in order that
     they may fight the battles of their brother who will rule over his enemies."</small></blockquote>This passage in the Bible has no reference to anything in the Bible itself, but it is made
clear from the passage in Jasher.<p>While the above two references pass the test, it will be up to the reader to satisfy himself
as to the general agreement of the entirety of the book with the Bible narrative. This is
such an extensive comparison, and such an obvious one, that I will not attempt to make
any verse by verse comparison.  Certainly any reader who is familiar with the Bible will
recognize its similarity to the text of Jasher.</p><p>There probably is no way that we can know that the Biblical writer(s) quoted from this
book, rather than the other way around?  Is it possible that this book was reverse
engineered?  Perhaps that Book of Jasher from the Amoraim period was compiled from
rabbinic sources such that it is a kind of digest of rabbinic traditions.  Indeed, there is
a great deal of commonality with accounts from other midrashic sources.  If this were
found to be so it would in no way diminish its value.  
</p><p>Is it possible that someone created this book as a clever fraud, by appropriating the
name of the Biblical Jasher to give the work credibility?  There are, of course, many
examples of such pious counterfeits from the early new testament period.  Could
someone have fabricated this book by incorporating a huge number of additional details
into the framework of Bible stories, and do it with such accuracy as to be convincing? 
It is remotely conceivable that some writer of the rabbinical period could have gathered
a vast array of those stories, as are common in rabbinical writings, and incorporated
them into this work in a framework to, in some way, add credibility to the stories.  But
such a scenario seems very unlikely, since rabbinical writings have a great deal of
credibility otherwise, and no major effort of promoting this book for that purpose has
ever occurred.  It is hard to imagine that this book would be counterfeited for that
purpose or any other.  There is simply no motive for such an act.  In any case, if this
were true, it is such a masterful job as to be a very valuable work in it's own right.  The
accuracy and credibility of this supposed Pseudo-Jasher is absolute genius.  If this be
a forgery it is a marvelous one.</p><p>Such a fraudulent writer would not have needed to add so much detail into the account
to be convincing.  The more details he drew from his imagination, the greater his
chances of making some glaring error that would give away his deception.  A faker
would certainly have written a much shorter work and left out unnecessary details. 
</p><p>In actuality, we have a wonderful example of just such a fraud.  I have in my possession
three different works that go by the title Sepher Hayasher or The Book of Jasher.  This
first is, of course, this book.  The second is the 13th century ethical treatise that I
mentioned earlier.  It makes no claim to being the Biblical Jasher and would never be
taken for it.  The third book is widely recognized for the fraud that it is.  It has been
republished by the Rosicrucian Order.  It claims to have been discovered by Flaccus
Albinus Alcuinus, Abbot of Canterbury in the 8th century, while on a pilgrimage.  It is the
briefest outline of the first six books of the Bible, consisting of about 70 pages of large
print.  It contains no useful details, and only the barest account of the familiar Hebrew
stories.  It seems to have been prepared hastily and with little attention to detail. The
most obvious feature is that it claims to be the work of a man named Jasher who was
the son of Caleb and one of the Judges of Israel. This seems to be its entire reason for
existence.  It is clear that the author had no real knowledge of Hebrew and failed to
recognize that Jasher is not a proper noun.  It is not anybody's name. It rather carries
the meaning of the upright book or the faithful record. Clearly this book is a fake.  It has
all the characteristics that you would expect to see in a forgery.  It is very brief and
contains no unique information except the one thing that is so absurd as to expose it as
a hoax.  So the contrast between that imitation and this book is very telling.  It is easy
to see which is genuine.</p><p>Finally, consider how Josephus described the Book of Jasher.  He said  "by this book
are to be understood certain records kept in some safe place on purpose, giving an
account of what happened among the Hebrews from year to year, and called Jasher or
the upright, on account of the fidelity of the annals."  There could be no better
description of the book you see before you.  The bottom line is that you, as the reader,
will have to answer the question of legitimacy for yourself.  Whichever side of that issue
you take, I think that you will be enlightened by exploring the issue and by reading the
book.  If you feel as I do, that this book has the powerful credentials to commend it as
<em>the </em>biblical Book of Jasher, you will now have in your hands an additional source to
investigate when studying the Bible.  You will also have much food for thought in regard
to the issues of conventional chronology in ancient times.

<center><p><b>William F. Dankenbring</b></p></center>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>, mentioned in the Biblical books of
Joshua and Second Chronicles, was faithfully translated into English from
the Rabbinical Hebrew in approximately A.D. 1840. Says the translator's
preface, "the ever memorable events and transactions recorded in Scripture
are with many others of the most interesting nature, comprehended in the
Book of Jasher; and they are all arrayed in that style of simple, unadorned
majesty and precision, which so particularly distinguishes the genius of
the Hebrew language/ and this, together with other numerous internal evidences,
it is presumed will go far to convince the Hebrew scholar that the book
is, with the exception of some doubtful parts, a venerable monument of
antiquity; and that, notwithstanding some few additions may have been made
to it in comparatively modern times, it still retains sufficient to prove
it a copy of the book referred to in Joshua, chapter x, and 2 Samuel, chap.
i. There are not more than seven or eight words in the whole book that
by construction can be derived from the Chaldean language" (page iii-iv).</p>

<p>The title of the book in Hebrew, <b><i>Sephir Ha Yasher</i></b>, literally
means "the book of the upright," or "the upright or correct
record." Some have thought that "Jasher" was the name of
a Hebrew judge in Israel, and a publication that arose in the middle of
the eighteenth century (circa 1750 A.D.), purported itself to be a translation
into English from a Hebrew manuscript of "Jasher" found at Gazna
in Persia. That book appears to have been a fictitious book, a fraud, and
most probably the work of some agnostic, cynical English skeptic, written
in imitation of the language of Scripture. Its author, in his ignorance,
presumed "Jasher" to have been the personal name of an ancient
Hebrew figure, the original writer. But the mischievous deed was recognized
by true scholars of Hebrew, for the pronoun "the" ("ha"
in Hebrew) never precedes or is prefixed to proper names.</p>

<p>How is the <b><i>Book of Jasher</i></b> important to us, today? It sheds
marvelous light on the Biblical story, from the time of Adam and Eve, the
time of Enoch, and the account of Noah's Deluge, to the Tower of Babel,
the tyrant Nimrod, and the story of Abraham and his descendants. Needless
to say, I cannot discuss the details of this remarkable historical record,
which completely authenticates and corroborates Scriptural history, filling
in many missing details deleted in the Scriptural record, in this article.
I highly recommend the book for any who desire to perfect their knowledge
of the ancient times, from Adam to the Exodus.</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> provides a fascinating glimpse into
the life of Enoch, who was a righteous ruler over men, continually instructing
them in truth and uprightness, and a knowledge of the Most High God. It
also tells us that in the days of "Peleg," not only were the
nations at Babel divided and scattered, but the earth itself was also divided.
From this book we also learn that Noah and Abraham were contemporaries.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important key found in the <b><i>Book of Jasher</i></b>
is that it corrects the erroneous chronological date for the birth of Abraham
assumed by many Christian commentators, in particular archbishop James
Ussher. Says the Translator of the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>:</p>

<ul>
<p>"From this book we learn that Noah and Abraham were contemporaries.
How beautiful the contemplation of the meeting of these two Patriarchs,
the one being a monument of God's mercy, the other having the promises
of the favor and grace of God, not only to himself, but to his seed after
him. This fact might be proved from Scripture; but from the 32nd verse
in the 11th chapter of Genesis, most of the Christian commentators have
erroneously dated the birth of Abraham 60 years later than it actually
took place; as it is generally stated that he was born A.M. [after man,
i.e., after Adam] 2008, whereas the regular calculation in the Bible leads
us to 60 years earlier, viz. 1948. The only cause of this error has been
that Abraham's departure from Haran, at the age of 75, is recorded close
to the description of the death of Terah, at the age of 205, in Gen. ch.
xi, v. 32" (p.vi).</p>
</ul>

<p>How should we view the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>, today? The translator
correctly points out that although it is not divine Scripture, it nevertheless
is a mighty historical and ancient work which relates directly to Biblical
historical times and events. Thus the translator does not recommend it
to people as Scripture, as a work of divine inspiration, but does "as
a monument of history, comparatively covered with the ivy of the remotest
ages; as a work, possessing in its language, all the characteristic simplicity
of patriarchal times; and as such, he conceives it peculiarly calculated
to illustrate and confirm the sacred truths handed down to us in the Scriptures"
(p.vii).</p>

<p>The translator concludes:</p>

<ul>
<p>"Like all other ancient writings, (except the inspired volume,)
it has in some respects suffered from the consuming hand of time; and there
is reason to believe that some additions have been made to it. In fine,
it contains a history of the lives and memorable transactions of all the
illustrious characteres recorded in sacred history, from Adam down to the
time of the Elders, who immediately succeeded Joshua" (<b><i>ibid</i></b>.).</p>
</ul>

<p>Having said these things, let's take a close look and see how the <b><i>book
of Jasher</i></b>, then, impacts our understanding of ancient Biblical
chronology, and what it means to us, today!</p>

<center><p><b>Chronology After the Flood</b></p></center>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> recounts the story of mankind from
Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, to the destruction of Noah's Flood (chapters
1-6). The story of the post-Flood world begins in chapter 7 where we are
told that Terah was 38 years old when he begat Haran and Nahor, the older
brothers of Abraham (v.22). What year was this? According to the chronology,
from the Flood, we discover that Noah was 600 years old at the time of
the Flood (Gen.7:6). The Flood occurred in the year 2348 B.C. Noah's son
Shem begat Arphaxad 2 years after the Flood (Gen.11:10), or in 2346 B.C.
From that time on we can trace the descendants of Shem (see Genesis 11:10-26):</p>

<ul>
<p>Descendant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived

</ul>

<ul>
<p>Terah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Abram &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2056
B.C.</p>
</ul>

<p>At this point, the Biblical genealogy tell us, "And Terah lived
seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran" (Gen.11:26). Yet
the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> clearly states that "Terah was thirty
eight years old, and he begat Haran and Nahor" (Jasher 9:22). Therefore,
the fact that the Bible says Terah was 70 when he begat Abram, Nahor and
Haran, must refer to the date when ABRAM was begotten -- 32 years after
his two brothers. Abram was the youngest of the three, but is listed first
because the birthright became his because of his righteousness and excellency.</p>

<p>This is a straight-forward chronology. However, it differs from that
of Archbishop James Ussher. Usher, in his mammoth chronological work, concluded
erroneously that Abram was born seventy five years before Terah his father
died. Terah died at the age of 205 (Gen.11:32). The next chapter of Genesis
tells us that God told Abram to leave his country and Abram did so at the
age of 75 (Gen.12:1-4). Ussher assumes that Terah's death and Abram's departure
for Canaan was the same year -- therefore, since Terah died in 1921 B.C.,
Abram's birth would have been, according to Ussher, 75 years sooner --
in 1996 B.C. Notice! This date is precisely 60 years later than the true
date for Abram's birth! Unfortunately, Archbishop Ussher did not have access
to the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> when he calculated the birth of Abram!</p>

<p>When this correction is made, however, it suddenly frees up our understanding
of events that occurred after the Flood. Much of this illumination comes
from the <i><b>book of Jasher</b>!</i></p>

<center><p><b>Nimrod and the Birth of Abram</b></p></center>

<p>Now let's pick up the story of Nimrod, the world's first tyrant, after
the Flood. The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> gives us a very interesting
insight into Nimrod's kingdom and personality. The story begins with his
father Cush. We read:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And Cush, the son of Ham, the son of Noah, took a wife in those
days, in his old age, and she bare a son, and they called his name Nimrod,
saying, At that time the sons ofd men began to rebel and transgress against
God, and the child grew up, and his father loved him exceedingly, for he
was the son of his old age.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And the garments of skin, which God made for Adam and his wife,
when they went out of the garden, were given to Cush. For after the death
of Adam and his wife, the garments were given to Enoch, the son of Jared,
and when Enoch was taken up to God, he gave them to Methuselah, his son.
And at the death of Methuselah, Noah took them and brought them to the
ark, and they were with him until he went out of the ark. And in their
going out, Ham stole those garments from Noah his father, and he took them
and hid them from his brothers. And when Ham begat his firstborn Cush,
he gave him the garments in secret, and they were with Cush many days.
And Cush also concealed them from his sons and brothers, and when Cush
had begotten Nimrod, he gave him those garments through his love for him,
and Nimrod grew up, and when he was twenty years old he put on those garments.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Nimrod became strong when he put on the garments, and God
gave him might and strength, and he was a mighty hunter in the earth. .
. . And when Nimrod was forty years old, at that time there was war between
his brethren and the children of Japheth, so that they were in the power
of his enemies. . . . And when Nimrod had joyfully returned from battle,
after having conquered his enemies, all his brethren . . . assembled to
make him king over them, and they placed the regal crown upon his head.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And he placed TERAH THE SON OF NAHOR the prince of his host, and
he dignified him and elevated him above all h is princes" (Jasher
7:23-41).</p>
</ul>

<p>Notice! Although the Bible does not mention these fine details in the
Scriptural narrative, nevertheless, Terah, Abram's father, was the commander-in-chief
of Nimrod's army! He was a very important man in the post-Flood world,
and in the government of Nimrod. This occurred when Nimrod was about forty
years of age. The account goes on:</p>

<ul>
<p>". . . . And Nimrod dwelt in Shinar . . . and his kingdom became
very great . . . and Nimrod reigned in the earth over all the sons of Noah,
and they were all under his power and counsel [he was the first World Ruler].
And all the earth was of one tongue and words of union, but Nimrod did
not go in the ways of the Lord. . . . And Terah, the son of Nahor, prince
of Nimrod's host, was in those days very great in the sight of the king
and his subjects, and the king and princes loved him, and they elevated
him very high.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Terah took a wife and her name was Ambhelo the daughter of
Cornebo; and the wife of Terah conceived and bare him a son in those days.
Terah was SEVENTY YEARS OLD when he begat him, and Terah called the name
of his son ABRAM, because the king had raised him in those days, and dignified
him above all his princes" (Jasher 7:44-51).</p>
</ul>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> therefore plainly tells us Abram was
born to Terah when he was 70 years old -- not 135, as Archbishop Ussher
thought. The story continues that at the birth of Abram, the astrologers
and wise men of Nimrod's kingdom saw a horrifying sign in the heavens,
which they understood to mean that the child born to Terah that night would
grow up and possess the earth, and would kill all the kings of the earth,
posing a great threat to Nimrod himself. A plot was hatched to kill the
child. Terah managed to save Abram by substituting the child of one of
his servants instead, and then hid Abram, his mother and nurse, in a cave
for ten years (Jasher 8:33-36).</p>

<p>The account goes on to tell us that Haran, Abram's oldest brother, took
a wife when he wad 39 years of age, and when he was 42, she bare to him
Sarai, in the tenth year of Abram's life (Jasher 9:1-4). Thus Sarai was
ten years younger than Abram, whom she would later marry. She was born
in 2046 B.C. This means that Haran was born 42 years earlier, in 2088 B.C.,
and was 32 years older than Abram. This is also corroborated in Jasher
12:16, where we read, "and Haran was in those days that Abram was
born thirty and two years old." He was born when Terah his father
was 38.</p>

<p>When Abram was ten years old, he came out of the cave. The king Nimrod
and all his soothsayers thought he was long dead by this time. However,
taking no chances, we read that:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And when Abram came out from the cave, he went to Noah and his
son Shem, and he remained with them to learn the instruction of the Lord
and his ways, and no man knew where Abram was, and Abram served Noah and
his son Shem for a long time.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Abram was in Noah's house thirty nine years, and Abram knew
the Lord from three days old, and he went in the ways of the Lord until
the day of his death, as Noah and his son Shem had taught him; and all
the sons of the earth in those days greatly transgressed against the Lord,
and they rebelled against him, and they served other gods, and the forgot
the Lord who had created them in the earth . . . . And Terah had twelve
gods of large size, made of wood and stone, after the twelve months of
the year. . . " (Jasher 5-8).</p>
</ul>

<p>Thus Abram, from age 10 to 49, was in the house of Noah, learning the
truth of God! This would have been from the year 2046 (the year Sarai was
born) until the year 2007 B.C. During this time, "king Nimrod reigned
securely, and all the earth was under his control, and all the earth was
of one tongue and words of union" (Jasher 9:20).</p>

<p>At this time Nimrod and his great men took counsel to build a "strong
tower, and its top reaching heaven: (verse 21). While they built it, they
"imagined in their hearts to war against him and to ascend into heaven"
(v.25). As the Scriptures tell us, and the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
confirms, the gigantic tower was destroyed in a mighty paroxysm. Says the
<b><i>book ofd Jasher</i></b>, "And as to the tower which the sons
of men built, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up one third part
thereof, and a fire also descended from heaven and burned another third,
and a third part is left to this day, and it is of that part which was
aloft, and its circumference is three days' walk" (v.38).</p>

<p>This tremendous event would have occurred just before Abram left the
house of Noah in the year 2007 B.C. The tower of Babel catastrophe, therefore,
would d have occurred somewhere around the year 2008 B.C. It was shortly
after this awesome lesson from the heavens, that Abram comes forth from
hiding and exile, and returns to the house of his father Terah.</p>

<center><p><b>Abram Confronts Nimrod</b></p></center>

<p>When Abram was 50 years old, he left Noah's house and returned to his
father's house. Terah was still steeped in idolatry, and still captain
of the host of Nimrod (Jasher 11:13-15). Abram remonstrated with his father
about his strange gods (verses 26-50). Incensed, Terah reported this incident
to Nimrod , who sent soldiers to seize Abram. Nimrod, all his princes,
and Terah were present, when Abram witnessed before them, urging the king
to repent of his follies and wickedness, his idolatries, and to serve the
"God of the whole universe, who created thee, and in whose power it
is to kill and keep alive" (Jasher 11:54-55). He ended his testimony,
saying, "O foolish, simple, and ignorant king, woe unto thee forever"
(v.56).</p>

<p>Nimrod was so indignant and full of wrath, that he ordered Abram put
into prison, and then asked his counselors what ought to be done with him.
They counseled that Abram should be thrown alive into a flaming furnace
and be burned to death (Jasher 12:6). For three days and nights a mighty
fire was prepared in the king's furnace, and all the inhabitants of the
land stood to see Abram being brought out to be burned. Jasher estimates
the crowd at about 900,000 (Jasher 12:7-8).</p>

<p>What happened? Jasher relates:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And the Lord loved Abram and he had compassion over him, and the
Lord came down and delivered Abram from the fire and he was not burned.
But all the cords with which they bound him were burned, while Abram remained
and walked about in the fire. . . . </p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Abram walked in the midst of the fire three days and three
nights, and all the servants of the king saw him walking in the fire, and
they came and told the king . . . . And when the king heard their words
his heart fainted and he would not believe them. . . and the king rose
to go and see it, and he saw Abram walking to and fro in the midst of the
fire . . ." (Jasher 12:24-28).</p>
</ul>

<p>At this time Abram was 50 years old. Nimrod was the son of Cush, the
son of Ham. Ham begat Cush probably 2346 B.C., two years this side of the
Flood. If Cush were 251 years of age, when he begat Nimrod, then Nimrod
would have been born in 2095 B.C. Remember, he was expressly born in Cush's
old age, "the son of his old age" (Jasher 7:23). Thus he would
have been about 30 years younger than Terah, the chief over his host. He
would have been approximately 40 years older than Abram.</p>

<p>Keep this date in mind, for later we will see how well it correlates
with another date signpost we will discover in the <i><b>book of Jasher</b>!</i>
There are many "date links" given in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
which are unavailable any where else.</p>

<center><p><b>Abram's Place of Safety</b></p></center>

<p>After this, king Nimrod had a disturbing dream, which his counselors
interpreted to mean that "the day will come when Abram and his seed
and the children of his household will war with my king, and they will
smite all the king's horses and all his troops . . . this means nothing
else but the seed of Abram which will slay the king in latter days"
(Jasher 12:53-55). Abram got secret word of this and the conspiracy to
have him killed, and "Abram hastened and ran for safety to the house
of Noah and his son Shem, and he concealed himself there and found a place
of safety" (v.61).</p>

<p>Terah came to visit his son, after he had been with Noah for a month,
at which time Abram encouraged his father to come with him to Canaan, so
that they would both be delivered from the hand of Nimrod (v.65). Terah
hearkened to his son's wisdom, and they came as far as the land of Haran,
and remained there (Jasher 13:1). "And Abram remained in the land
of Haran three years, and at the expiration of three years the Lord appeared
to Abram and said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee forth from Ur
Casdim, and delivered thee from the hands of all thine enemies. And now
therefore if thou wilt hearken to my voice and keep my commandments, my
statutes and my laws, then will I cause thy enemies to fall before thee,
and I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven . . ." (Jasher
13:3-4). At this time God told Abram, "Arise now, take thy wife and
all belonging to thee and go to the land of Canaan and remain there . .
." (v.5).</p>

<center><p><b>Abram's First Trip to Canaan</b></p></center>

<p>Abram went to Canaan, and dwelt there 3 years. Jasher records, "At
that time, at the end of three years' of Abram's dwelling in the land of
Canaan, in that year Noah died, which was the fifty-eighth year of the
life of Abram; and all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years
and he died" (Jasher 13:9).</p>

<p>Noah was 600 years when the Flood came. He lived beyond the Flood 350
more years, and died in the year 1998 B.C. Abram was born in 2056 B.C.
Thus Noah indeed died in Abram's 58th year, just as the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
tells us!</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> then tells us, "And in the tenth
year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan (7 more years, or in the
year 1991 B.C., when Abram was 65) there was war between Nimrod king of
Shinar and Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Nimrod came to fight with Chedorlaomer
and to subdue him. For Chedorlaomer was at that time one of the princes
of the hosts of Nimrod. . . . And Nimrod assembled all his princes and
subjects, about seven hundred thousand men, and went against Chedorlaomer,
and Chedorlaomer went out to meet him with five thousand men . . . And
all those kings fought there, and Nimrod and his people were smitten .
. . and there fell from Nimrod's men about six hundred thousand . . . And
Nimrod fled and returned in shame and disgrace to his own land, and he
was under subjection to Chedorlaomer for a long time" (Jasher 13:12-16).</p>

<p>Jasher continues the story of Abram: "And it was in the fifteenth
year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, which is the seventieth
year of the life of Abram (the year 1986 B.C.), and the Lord appeared to
Abram in that year and he said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee out
from Ur Chasdim to give thee this land for an inheritance. Now therefore
walk before me and be perfect and keep my commandments . . . And thou shalt
come to thy fathers in peace and in good age, and the fourth generation
shall return here in this land and INHERIT IT FOREVER" (Jasher 13:17-19).</p>

<p>Now notice carefully! God told Abram that He would give him the land
from the river of Egypt, the Nile, to the river Euphrates -- and he then
told Abram that he would die, peaceably, and in a good old age -- but notice
now! Abram would RETURN in the fourth generation, and inherit the land
FOREVER! This is a prophecy for the FUTURE! In this instance, the fourth
"generation" means 4,000 years, for a full "generation"
is a thousand years in fulfillment -- one "day" (II Pet.3:8-10).
Abram was born and lived circa 2,000 B.C. Four "generations"
or four thousand years from that time brings us to circa 2000 A.D.! This
is one more astonishing evidence that we are surely living in the generation
of the END TIME!</p>

<center><p><b>Abram's SECOND Journey to Canaan!</b></p></center>

<p>Now let's continue the story of Abram. "At that time Abram returned
and went to Haran, to see his father and mother, and his father's household,
and Abram and his wife and all belonging to him returned to Haran, and
Abram dwelt in Haran five years. And many of the people of Haran, about
seventy two men, followed Abram and Abram taught them the instruction of
the Lord and his ways, and he taught them to know the Lord. In those days
the Lord appeared to Abram in Haran, and he said to him, Behold, I spoke
unto thee these twenty years back saying, Go forth from thy land, from
thy birth-place and from thy father's house, to the land which I have shown
thee to give it to thee and to thy children . . . Now therefore arise,
go forth from this place, thou, thy wife, and all belonging to thee . .
. and rise to return to the land of Canaan.</p>

<ul>
<p>"And Abram arose and took his wife Sarai and all belonging to him
. . . and they came out to go to the land of Canaan. And Abram went and
returned to the land of Canaan, according to the word of the Lord. And
Lot the son of his brother Haran went with him, and Abram was SEVENTY FIVE
YEARS OLD when he went forth from Haran to return to the land of Canaan"
(Jasher 13:20-26).</p>
</ul>

<p>This was the SECOND time Abram went to the land of Canaan! The first
time was when he was 55 years of age. This was 20 years later, when he
was 75 years of age. The Bible does not tell us about these two different
times Abram went to the land of Canaan. The book of Genesis telescopes
and shortens much of the real story, giving us the highlights, as it were.
But the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> fills in many very interesting and
astounding details, giving us the true chronological order of the various
events, births, and deaths, of the patriarchs, and recounts for us their
activities and lives.</p>

<p>This second time Abraham went to Canaan, is also recorded in the book
of Genesis, chapter 12. Here we are told that Abram departed, at age seventy
five, taking Sarai, Lot, and all his substance with him (Gen.12:3). This
was the year 1981 B.C.</p>

<p>Let us now skip down to the next events noted in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>.
Abraham was dwelling in the plain of Mamre many years, and his nephew Lot
had decided to move down to the Sodom valley (Jasher 15). At that time,
a war broke out.</p>

<center><p><b>War in the Middle East!</b></p></center>

<ul>
<p>"At that time Chedorlaomer king of Elam sent to all the neighboring
kings, to Nimrod, king of Shinar, who was then under his power, and to
Tidal, king of Goyim, and to Arioch, king of Elasar, with whom he had a
covenant, saying, Come up to me and assist me, that we may smite all the
towns of Sodom . . . for they have rebelled against me these thirteen years.
And these four kings went up with all their camps, about eight hundred
thousand men . . . And these nine kings made war in the valley of Siddom;
and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were smitten before the kings of Elam"
(Jasher 16:1-4).</p>
</ul>

<p>At this time, Abraham delivered his nephew Lot who had been taken captive
by the kings who attacked Sodom. He smote them at night, when their troops
were drunken and feasting, in a sudden surprise attack with only 318 men
(Jasher 16:7). It is another intriguing story, whose details are filled
out more completely in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>.</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> contains an absorbing account of the
sins of the people of Sodom, and why God became furious with them, and
the account of their divine judgment.</p>

<center><p><b>The Birth of Isaac and Death of Terah</b></p></center>

<p>Picking up the story, the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> also records
the miraculous birth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 years of age. Since
Abraham was born in 2056 B.C., the birth of Isaac would have occurred in
the year 1956 B.C. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was
weaned, and "Shem and Eber and all the great people of the land, and
Abimelech king of the Philistines . . . came to eat and drink and rejoice
at the feast which Abraham made" (Jasher 21:5). "Also Terah .
. . came from Haran, they and all belonging to them, for they greatly rejoiced
on hearing that a son had been born to Sarah" (v.6).</p>

<p>The next chronological link in the story, comes in chapter 22 of Jasher.</p>

<ul>
<p>"And Terah died in that year, that is, in the thirty-fifth year
of the birth of Isaac son of Abraham. And the days of Terah were two hundred
and five years, and he was buried in Haran" (Jasher 22:33-34).</p>
</ul>

<p>Terah was born in 2126 B.C. The Scriptures also tell us he was 205 years
old when he died (Genesis 11:32). This means he died in the year 1921 B.C.
On the other hand, Isaac was born in the 100th year of Abraham. Abraham
was born in 2056. This puts the birth of Isaac in the year 1956 B.C. If
we subtract 35 years from 1956, we come up with 1921 -- the very same year.</p>

<p>Thus the Bible, and the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>, are in complete
agreement on Biblical chronology from Flood, down through the birth of
Terah, Abraham's father, to Abraham, and down to the birth of Abraham's
promised son, Isaac!</p>

<center><p><b>The Binding of Isaac and Death of Sarah</b></p></center>

<p>The intriguing account of the "binding of Isaac" is then recounted
in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>, the story of the near sacrifice of
this wonderful and obedient son, which is also recounted in the book of
Genesis (chapter 22). Isaac at this time was 37 years old (Jasher 22:41).
Therefore, this event would have occurred in 1919 B.C.</p>

<p>This was a very traumatic experience, especially for Sarah, who was
devoted to her son, and who at one point was told that he had been "sacrificed"
by Abraham. Not knowing the truth, that Isaac had been spared, her heart
was heavy with grief, but she still had faith in God. When she heard that
Isaac was still alive after all, she could hardly take in the good news,
and joyous at this wonderful news, her heart was overcome, and she died
soon thereafter, but in joy, not in grief. This is not the place to go
into this incredible story, nor the time, but it is recommended reading
for all students who are serious about the Bible and its message. The year
would have been 1919 B.C.</p>

<p>Sarah died at the age of 127 years (Jasher 24:1). She was born ten years
after Abraham, or in 2046 B.C. This would put her death in the year 1919
B.C., the same year as the "binding of Isaac," actually following
shortly after it.</p>

<p>Sarah was buried with great pomp and ceremony, as befits a queen. "And
Abraham buried Sarah with pomp as observed at the interment of kings, and
she was buried in very fine and beautiful garments. And at her bier was
Shem, his sons Eber and Abimelech, together with Anar, Ashcol and Mamre,
and all the grandees of the land followed her bier" (Jasher 24:13-14).</p>

<center><p><b>Births of Jacob and Esau</b></p></center>

<p>The next important event chronicled in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
is Isaac, the son of Abraham, taking a wife. "And Isaac took Rebecca
and she became his wife, and he brought her into his tent. And Isaac was
forty years old when he took Rebecca, the daughter of his uncle Bethuel,
for a wife" (Jasher 24:44-45). Isaac married Rebecca, when he was
forty years of age, so this would have been in the year 1916 B.C.</p>

<p>Rebecca bore no children for many years. But the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
records, "And in the fifty-ninth year of the life of Isaac the son
of Abraham, Rebecca his wife was still barren in those days" (Jasher
26:1). Isaac's 59th year would have been 1897 B.C.</p>

<p>Rebecca asked her husband Isaac to pray for her to have children, even
as Abraham had prayed for Sarah, who also had been barren. Isaac does so,
and the Lord heard his earnest prayer, and Rebecca conceives (Jasher 26:2-8).
She had twins -- Esau and Jacob -- who struggled for dominance even while
in her womb. This would have been circa 1896 B.C., when God answered Isaac's
prayer, and the prayers of Shem, Eber, and Abraham, and Esau and Jacob
were born! Isaac was 60 years old when Jacob and Esau were born.</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> goes on to tell us, "and the boys
grew up to their fifteen year, and they came amongst the society of men.
Esau was a designing and deceitful man, an excellent hunter in the field,
and Jacob was a man perfect and wise, dwelling in tents, feeding flocks
and learning the instructions of the Lord and the commandments of his father
and mother" (Jasher 26:17).</p>

<p>The chronology of Jasher therefore informs us that Rebecca conceived
when Isaac was 59, 19 years after she married Isaac. She delivered two
children the following year. Therefore, Esau and Jacob were born in 1896
B.C. Fifteen years later, when they were strapping youths and Esau had
become an excellent hunter, would have been the year 1881 B.C.</p>

<center><p><b>The Death of Righteous Abraham</b></p></center>

<p>"And it was at that time that Abraham died, in the fifteenth year
of the life of Jacob and Esau, the sons of Isaac, and all the days of Abraham
were one hundred and seventy five years, and he died and was gathered to
his people in good old age, old and satisfied with days, and Isaac and
Ishmael his sons buried him" (Jasher 26:29). All the kings and princes
of Canaan came to Abraham's funeral, to bury him, and all the people of
Haran, and all the princes and grandees among the sons of Abraham by the
concubines. Born in 1896 B.C., Jacob and Esau would have been 15 years
of age in 1881 B.C. Abraham would have been 175 years of age.</p>

<p>Says Jasher of this remarkable man of faith and obedience to God: "And
there arose not a man who feared God like unto Abraham, for he had feared
his God from his youth, and had served the Lord, and had gone in all his
ways during his life, from his childhood to the day of his death. And the
Lord was with him and delivered him from the counsel of Nimrod and his
people, and when he made war with the four kings of Elam he conquered them.
And he brought all the children of the earth to the service of God, and
he taught them the ways of the Lord, and caused them to know the Lord.
And he formed a grove and he planted a vineyard therein, and he had always
prepared in his tent meat and drink to those who passed through the land,
that they might satisfy themselves in his house. And the Lord God delivered
the whole earth on account of Abraham" (Jasher 26:34-38).</p>

<center><p><b>Esau the Hunter Ambushes Nimrod!</b></p></center>

<p>After the death of Abraham, when Esau was 16 years of age, he went into
the wilds to hunt game, as was his custom. Jasher tells us:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And Esau at that time, after the death of Abraham, frequently
went into the field to hunt. And Nimrod king of Babel, the same was Amraphel,
also frequently went with his mighty men to hunt in the field, and to walk
about in the cool of the day. And Nimrod was observing Esau all the days,
for a jealousy was formed in the heart of Nimrod against Esau all the days.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And on a certain day Esau went into the field to hunt, and he
found Nimrod walking in the wilderness with his two men. And all his mighty
men and his people were with him in the wilderness, but they removed at
a distance from him, and they went from him in different directions to
hunt, and Esau concealed himself for Nimrod, and he lurked for him in the
wilderness. . . .</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Nimrod and two of his men that were with him came to the place
where they were when Esau started suddenly from his lurking place, and
drew his sword, and hastened, and ran to Nimrod and cut off his head.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Esau fought a desperate fight with the two men that were with
Nimrod, and when they called out to him, Esau turned to them and smote
them to death with his sword. . . . And when Esau saw the mighty men of
Nimrod coming at a distance, he fled, and thereby escaped; and Esau took
the valuable garments of Nimrod, which Nimrod's father had bequeathed to
Nimrod, and with which Nimrod prevailed over the whole land, and he ran
and concealed them in his house.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And Esau took those garments and ran into the city on account
of Nimrod's men, and he came into his father's house weary and exhausted
from fight, and he was ready to die through grief when he approached his
brother Jacob and sat before him. And he said to his brother Jacob, Behold
I shall die this day, and wherefore then do I want the birthright? And
Jacob acted wisely with Esau in this matter, and Esau sold his birthright
to Jacob, for it was so brought about by the Lord. . . . .</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And when Nimrod the son of Cush died, his men lifted him up and
brought him in consternation, and buried him in his city, and all the days
that Nimrod lives were two hundred and fifteen years and he died"
(Jasher 27:1-15).</p>
</ul>

<p>Nimrod was slain by Esau when Esau was 16 years of age. At that time,
we are here told, Nimrod himself was 215 years of age. Since Esau was 16
in the year 1880 B.C., when Nimrod was killed, and Nimrod was 215 in that
same year, then we can calculate the actual birth year of Nimrod. Nimrod
was born in the year 2095 B.C. Notice how beautifully all these figures
correlate together!</p>

<p>Nimrod, born to Cush in his old age, would have been an old man at this
time, when Esau, the young "sport," saw his chance and assassinated
the old king! At this time Esau stole the garments God had made for Adam
and Eve, which Nimrod had been given by his father Cush who himself had
stolen them from Noah. Evidently, Esau saw these as his means and way to
power and kingship in the earth. Yet not long later, famished and feeling
on the verge of death, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of
bean soup!</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> continues:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And the days that Nimrod reigned upon the people of the land were
one hundred and eighty-five years; and Nimrod died by the sword of Esau
in shame and contempt, and the seed of Abraham caused his death as he had
seen in his dream.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>"And at the death of Nimrod his kingdom became divided into many
divisions, and all those parts that Nimrod reigned over were restored to
the respective kings of the land, who recovered them after the death of
Nimrod, and all the people of the house of Nimrod were for a long time
enslaved to all the other kings of the land" (Jasher 27:16-17).</p>
</ul>

<p>After his untimely death, Niimrod's kingdom did not endure. It became
all divided up into the hands of the original kings of the various lands
which he had conquered.</p>

<center><p><b>After Nimrod -- Jacob and Esau</b></p></center>

<p>After this time, a number of deaths of prominent, righteous men are
recorded in the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>. Two years later, "Shelach,
the son of Arphaxad, died in that year, which is the eighteenth year of
the lives of Jacob and Esau; and all the days that Shelach lived were four
hundred and eighty three years and he died.</p>

<ul>
<p>"At that time Isaac sent his younger son Jacob to the house of
Shem and Eber, and he learned the instructions of the Lord, and Jacob remained
in the house of Shem and Eber thirty two years, and Esau his brother did
not go, for he was not willing to go, and he remained in his father's house
in the land of Canaan" (Jasher 28:17-18).</p>
</ul>

<p>The year Shelach died, then, was 1880 B.C. In that same year Jacob was
sent to the house of Shem and Eber, to learn the ways of God, even as Abraham
had been, and he remained there for 32 years -- from 1880 until 1848 B.C.,
when he returned to Isaac and Rebecca. Esau in the meantime, roamed widely
in his hunting trips, and when he was 40 years of age he married a Canaanite
woman living in the land of Seir (Jasher 28:22-23).</p>

<p>At this point, the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> gives us another vital
benchmark. We read:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And it came to pass in those days, in the hundred and tenth year
of the life of Isaac, that is, in the fiftieth year of the life of Jacob,
in that year died SHEM the son of NOAH; Shem was 600 years old at his death.
And when Shem died Jacob returned to his father in Hebron" (Jasher
29:24-25).</p>
</ul>

<p>Shem died then in the year 1846 B.C. He was born 98 years before the
Flood (he was 100 years old two years after the Flood -- see Gen.11:10),
and died 500 years after the birth of Arphaxad (Gen.11:11). The Flood occurred
in 2348 B.C. Since Shem was 600 when he died, and since he was born 2446
B.C, his death would have been in 1846 B.C.</p>

<p>Since the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> shows that Jacob was 50 years
old and Isaac was 110 at this point in time, when Shem died, these facts
once again confirming that Jacob's birth was in 1896, (fifty years before),
and the birth of Isaac was in 1956 B.C. (110 years before).</p>

<center><p><b>Jacob Versus Esau -- the Rivalry</b></p></center>

<p>After this, we come to the story of Isaac growing old and desiring venison
from his son Esau, after which he promises to "bless him." Rebecca
and Jacob pull a trick on Isaac, and Jacob disguises himself as Esau, and
"steals" his birthright (which really wasn't Esau's any more
anyway, since he had already sold it to Jacob.</p>

<p>Esau is so enraged at this act of trickery, that he vows to kill Jacob.
We read, "And Jacob was very much afraid of his brother Esau, and
he rose up and fled to the house of Eber the son of Shem, and he concealed
himself there on account of his brother, and Jacob was sixty three years
old when he went forth from the land of Canaan from Hebron, and Jacob was
concealed in Eber's house fourteen years on account of his brother Esau,
and he there continued to learn the ways of the Lord and his commandments"
(Jasher 29:11).</p>

<p>Jacob therefore must have fled to Eber's abode 13 years after Shem's
death in 1846. This would put his flight in 1833 B.C. Ishmael, the brother
of Isaac, died the following year, "in the sixty fourth year of the
life of Jacob" (Jasher 29:18). Jacob continued hiding at Eber's place
for 14 years, or until 1819 B.C. Jacob became homesick, and returned to
Hebron, only to learn that Esau had neither forgotten nor forgiven him
for stealing his "blessing." Alarmed, Isaac and Rebecca counsel
Jacob to flee to Haran, to her family there, for refuge, and to find a
mate for himself. "Jacob was seventy seven years old when he went
out from the land of Canaan from Beersheba" (Jasher 29:30). This would
have been the year 1819, showing he did not dilly dally long in Canaan,
when his life was at great risk!</p>

<p>Two years later, we read, "And in the second year of Jacob's dwelling
in Haran, that is in the seventy ninth year of the life of Jacob, in that
year died Eber the son of Shem, he was four hundred and sixty four years
old at his death" (Jasher 30:16). This would have been 1817 B.C.</p>

<p>After Jacob dwelt 20 years with Laban, serving him, marrying his two
daughters Leah and Rachel, Jacob noted that conditions were getting difficult
for him and his growing family. Laban had changed his wages deceitfully
ten times, and sought to impoverish Jacob, but God turned his conniving
trickery into a blessing for Jacob, and supernaturally blessed his sheep.
At the end of 20 years, God appeared to Jacob, and told him to go back
to Canaan (Jasher 31:37, 32:3).</p>

<p>Of course, this meant he would encounter Esau once again. Esau indeed
came out to seek vengeance on Jacob, but the <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
informs us:</p>

<ul>
<p>"And the Lord heard the prayer of Jacob on that day, and the Lord
then delivered Jacob from the hands of his brother Esau. And the Lord sent
three angels of the angels of heaven, and they went before Esau and came
to him. And these angels appeared to Esau and his people as two thousand
men, riding upon horses furnished with all sorts of war instruments, and
they appeared in the sight of Esau and all his men to be divided into four
camps, with four chiefs to them. And one camp went on and they found Esau
coming with four hundred men toward his brother Jacob, and this camp ran
toward Esau and his people and terrified them, and Esau fell off the horse
in alarm, and all his men separated from him in that place, for they were
greatly afraid. And the whole of the camp shouted after them when they
fled from Esau, and all the warlike men answered, saying, Surely we are
the servants of Jacob, who is the servant of God, and who then can stand
against us? (Jasher 32:27-32).</p>
</ul>

<p>Four times such camps of angels ran at Esau and his men, terrifying
them and causing them great anguish and astonishment. No doubt many of
them wet their breeches that day. After these awesome, frightening events,
Esau's heart was temporarily changed, and instead of seeking to destroy
his brother, he came to him in peace. He concealed his hatred in his heart,
because of his fear (32:39-40). The return of Jacob to Canaan would have
been 20 years after he left, or the year 1799-1800 B.C.</p>

<p>"And it was in those days, in that year, being the hundred and
sixth year of the life of Jacob, in the tenth year of Jacob's coming from
Padan-aram, that Leah the wife of Jacob died; she was fifty one years old
when she died in Hebron" (Jasher 41:2). This would have been the year
1790 B.C. Leah therefore was born 1841 B.C. </p>

<center><p><b>The Story of Joseph</b></p></center>

<p>In the following year, Joseph, the son of Jacob, being a younger son,
was "seventeen years old" when he dreamed a dream that seemed
to exalt him over his brothers, causing them great anger and animosity
(Jasher 41:9). This may have been in 1789 B.C., following the death of
Leah. Soon they had enough of his "sass," and counseled to get
rid of him -- permanently. Joseph was sold as a slave and would up a slave
of Potiphar in Egypt. The next year, when Joseph was 18 years of age, 1788
B.C., that he came to the attention of Potiphar's wife, who fell in deep
lust with the young Hebrew lad (Jasher 44:14-16). She later accused Joseph
of attempting to rape her, and Potiphar, believing her report, had Joseph
cast into the king's prison; "and Joseph was in the house of confinement
twelve years" (Jasher 44:76; see also 46:20). This period of imprisonment
in the dungeon would have been from 1788 to 1776 B.C. Joseph was thrown
into the prison at the age of 18, and remained there 12 years, or until
age 30.</p>

<p>During this period, Isaac died at the age of 180 years. "And Jacob
and Esau fell upon the face of their father Isaac, and they wept, and Isaac
was one hundred and eighty years old when he died in the land of Canaan,
in Hebron, and his sons carried him to the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham
had bought. . . . And all the kings of the land of Canaan went with Jacob
and Esau to bury Isaac . . ." (Jasher 47:10-11). The year would have
been 1776 B.C., the final year of Joseph in the dungeon.</p>

<p>The story of how Joseph was delivered from prison, and interpreted the
Pharaoh's dreams, and became second-in-command throughout all the land
of Egypt, is well known. The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> again gives a
much more detailed picture of the story. The author declares, "And
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and Joseph went
out before the king, and he became the king's second in Egypt" (Jasher
49:38). Joseph built himself a beautiful mansion, "like unto the houses
of kings" (v.39), "three years was Joseph erecting his house"
(v.40). Joseph even had an army, numbering 40,000 troops. The year? 1776
B.C. Interesting, isn't it, that the modern end-time "HOUSE of JOSEPH,"
-- the United States of America -- has its Year of Independence also as
1776 -- that is, 1776 A.D.!!!</p>

<p>"At the revolution of the year, in the second year of Joseph's
reigning over Egypt, the Lord gave great plenty throughout the land for
seven years as Joseph had spoken, for the Lord blessed all the produce
of the land in those days for seven years, and they ate and were greatly
satisfied" (Jasher 50:7). Joseph stored the excess grain in silos
and treasuries. For seven years they stored up all the extra, surplus grain,
knowing that the seven years of famine were coming. These seven bountiful
years would have been 1775-1769. Therefore, the crushing years of famine
and drought would have been 1768-1762.</p>

<p>The story of the reconciliation of Joseph with his brothers who had
sold him into slavery, is well known. The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b>
adds much more detail to this incredible Biblical epic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, at the closing stages of the famine, Jacob and his entire
family go to Egypt, to live with Joseph, where they are given the choice
land of Goshen in the Nile Delta for their inheritance. They live there
many years and are incredibly blessed. Jacob blesses the two children of
Joseph, born in Egypt, Ephraim and Manasseh, and adopts them as his own.
The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> tells us: "And Joseph was very aged,
advanced in years, and his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, remained constantly
in the house of Jacob, together with the children of the sons of Jacob
their brethren, to learn the ways of the Lord and his law" (Jasher
55:35).</p>

<p>"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the
days of Jacob, and the years of his life, were a hundred and forty seven
years" (Jasher 56:1). Thus Jacob was 147 years old when he died. Since
he was born in 1896, his death occurred in the year 1749 B.C. Since he
was in Egypt 17 years, then Jacob immigrated to Egypt in the year 1766
B.C.</p>

<center><p><b>Chronology and the Exodus Saga</b></p></center>

<p>In the book of Exodus, we read an amazing statement: "Now the sojourning
of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty
years. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went
out from the land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:40-41).</p>

<p>Now, Archbishop Ussher in his chronology counts this period of time
beginning with the sojourn of Abraham in Canaan, which he dates to 1921
B.C., the year that Terah, the father of Abraham died, and the year he
believed that Abraham first went to Canaan (Gen.12:1-3), that is, Abraham's
75th year (Gen.12:4).</p>

<p>However, we have seen in the book of Jasher that indeed Terah died in
1921 B.C. But Abraham's departure for Canaan when he was 75 years of age
took place in the year 1981 B.C., or sixty years earlier than Ussher suggests.</p>

<p>What events, then, can we tie the figure 430 years to, during which
the "children of Israel sojourned"?</p>

<p>Obviously, the death of Terah is one linch pin. It is 430 years indeed
from the death of Terah, Abraham's father, to the Exodus from Egypt in
1491 B.C.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the death of Terah coincides also with the 35th year
of Isaac, the son of Abraham. This was only two years before the supreme
test when Abraham took Isaac to Mount Moriah to be a "human sacrifice."
Although God did not require Abraham to go through with this deed, it is
symbolical of the fact that God the Father did willingly sacrifice His
Son, Jesus Christ -- Yeshua the Messiah -- to pay the penalty of our sins,
out of His great love for us. The story of Abraham and Isaac vividly pictures
that awesome divine love. It pictures not only God's love for us, but God's
awesome love for His Son, and His Son's tremendous love for God the Father!</p>

<p>Why would the death of Terah be significant as the starting point of
the 430 years of suffering and affliction of the children of Israel?</p>

<p>Could it be partly because Terah, with his power and authority, and
widespread respect, was a protective influence over Abraham and his children,
so long as Terah lived? No doubt he did his best to help his son so long
as he was alive, supplying information, news, and vital intelligence from
his own networks as the one-time commander of the hosts of Babylon. Then,
just two years after this change in the life of Abraham and his descendants,
God called upon Abraham for the greatest sacrifice a parent can make --
to sacrifice his own son (Genesis 22).</p>

<p>In very real and meaningful sense, the "binding of Isaac"
pictures the GREATEST travail and suffering human beings can be required
to suffer. The loss of one's own son, or daughter, or children, is the
greatest trauma a parent can suffer. The binding of Isaac very likely occurred
on Passover eve, at the very time the Passover lambs were sacrificed at
the Temple!</p>

<p>If we count the beginning of the sojourn of Israel from the death of
Terah, as Ussher does, then his date for the Exodus is entirely correct.
Abraham himself did not first enter Canaan on that date, but 60 years earlier.
However, the Scripture in Exodus speaks of "the sojourning of the
CHILDREN of Israel," and not Abraham himself. Although Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob are all considered "Israel," in the greater sense,
since they are the three great Patriarchs, the sojourning -- when Abraham,
Isaac, and their families were completely cut off from outside support
-- would have begun at the death of Abraham's father, Terah. His death
would have marked the time when they were entirely "on their own,"
as it were.</p>

<p>The <b><i>book of Jasher</i></b> sheds marvelous light on the chronology
of the years between the Flood and the children of Israel entering Egypt.
It does not alter the frame of Ussher's chronology. Creation would still
be in 4004 B.C. The Flood would still be in 2348 B.C. The only changes
would be the birth dates of Abraham and his children, by putting them all
60 years earlier. This means the sojourn in Egypt itself also began 60
years earlier than Ussher's date.</p>

<p>This happy coincidence provides us an additional 60 years of the children
of Israel in Egypt to reproduce like rabbits so their progeny, by the time
of the Exodus, includes 600,000 males, besides women and children. Ussher's
chronology puts the sojourn of Jacob and his family in Egypt as beginning
in 1706. He puts the Exodus in 1491. The difference is only 215 years total,
for Jacob's family to grow from 70 people to something like 2-3 million!</p>

<p>However, the reconstruction of the chronology from the Flood to the
Sojourn in Egypt gives us another 60 years -- or a total of 275 years in
Egypt, for Israel to reproduce and multiply -- another two generations
to accomplish the exponential growth rate required!</p>

<p>Also, by backing up the birth of Abraham by 60 years, suddenly many
pieces of the historical puzzle begin to click, and fit together. Now we
see Abraham was actually taught by Noah himself the ways of the Lord. Isaac
also was taught by Noah and Shem. Jacob also spent years in the house of
Shem and Eber. The new chronology also helps us to pinpoint in history
the Tower of Babel cataclysm, the birth of Nimrod, and Nimrod's rise to
power, his relationship to Terah, Abraham's father, and his dealings with
Abraham himself, and his children, and his murder at the hands of Esau,
Isaac's son. It's all quite a fascinating story. Read it -- for yourself!</p>
