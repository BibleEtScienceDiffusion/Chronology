<LI>And Judah went at that time to Adulam, and he came to a man of Adulam, and his name

<LI>And Aphlaleth was barren, she had no offspring, and God afterward remembered Aphlaleth
the wife of Dan, and she conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Chushim.<P>

<LI>And Gad and Naphtali went to  Haran and took from thence the daughters of Amuram the son of Uz, the son of Nahor, for
wives.<P>

<LI>And these are the names of the daughters of Amuram; the name of the elder was
Merimah, and the name of the younger Uzith; and Naphtali took Merimah, and Gad took

<LI>And Adon the wife of Asher died in those days: she had no offspring; and it was after the
death of Adon that Asher went to the other side of the river and took for a wife Hadurah the
daughter of Abimael, the son of Eber, the son of Shem.<P>

<LI>And the young woman was of a comely appearance, and a woman of sense, and she had
been the wife of Malkiel the son of Elam, the son of Shem.<P>

<LI>And Hadurah bare a daughter unto Malkiel, and he called her name Serach, and Malkiel

<LI>And after the death of the wife at Asher he went and took Hadurah for a wife, and brought
her to the land of Canaan, and Serach her daughter he also brought with them, and she was
three years old, and the damsel was brought up in Jacob's house.<P>

<LI>And the damsel was of a comely appearance, and she went in the sanctified ways of the

<LI>And Hadurah the wife of Asher conceived and bare unto him Yimnah, Yishvah, Yishvi and

<LI>And in those days Judah went to the house of Shem and took Tamar the daughter of
Elam, the son of Shem, for a wife for his first born Er.<P>

<LI>And Er came to his wife Tamar, and she became his wife, and when he came to her he
outwardly destroyed his seed, and his work was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord
slew him.<P>

<LI>And it was after the death of Er, Judah's first born, that Judah said unto Onan, go to thy
brother's wife and marry her as the next of kin, and raise up seed to thy brother.<P>

<LI>And Onan took Tamar for a wife  and he came to her, and Onan also did like unto the work of his brother, and his work was evil
in the sight of the Lord, and he slew him also.<P>

<LI>And when Onan died, Judah said unto Tamar, Remain in thy father's house until my son
Shiloh shall have grown up, and Judah did no more delight in Tamar, to give her unto Shiloh,
for he said, Peradventure he will also die like his brothers.<P>

<LI>And Tamar rose up and went and remained in her father's house, and Tamar was in her
father's house for some time.<P>

<LI>And at the revolution of the year, Aliyath the wife of Judah died; and Judah was comforted
for his wife, and after the death of Aliyath, Judah went up with his friend Hirah to Timnah to
shear their sheep.<P>

<LI>And Tamar heard that Judah had gone up to Timnah to shear the sheep, and that Shiloh
was grown up, and Judah did not delight in her.<P>

<LI>And Tamar rose up and put off the garments of her widowhood, and she put a vail upon
her, and she entirely covered herself, and she went and sat in the public thoroughfare, which
is upon the road to Timnah.<P>

<LI>And Judah passed and saw her and took her and he came to her, and she conceived by
him, and at the time of being delivered, behold, there were twins in her womb, and he called
the name of the first Perez, and the name of the second Zarah.<P>
